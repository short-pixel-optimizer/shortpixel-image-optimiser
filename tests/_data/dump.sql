The technical term is ‘lazy loading.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On mobile, lazy loading can also keep browsers from loading files meant for other devices. That can save your readers money on data — and help preserve battery life.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Search</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Say hello to your new sitemap.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress sites work well with search engines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, by default, WordPress 5.5 includes an XML sitemap that helps search engines discover your most important pages from the very minute you go live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So more people will find your site sooner, giving you more time to engage, retain and convert them to subscribers, customers or whatever fits your definition of success.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ebcd3d\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:96%\">\n<h2>Security</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.5/auto-updates.mp4\"></video><figcaption>Now you can choose to update plugins and themes automatically–or pick just a few–from the screens you’ve always used.</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Auto-updates for Plugins and Themes</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can set plugins and themes to update automatically — or not! — in the WordPress admin. So you always know your site is running the latest code available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also turn auto-updates on or off for each plugin or theme you have installed — all on the same screens you’ve always used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Update by uploading ZIP files</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If updating plugins and themes manually is your thing, now that’s easier too — just upload a ZIP file.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-background\" style=\"background-color:#f2edd4\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:96%\">\n<h2>Highlights from the block editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once again, the latest WordPress release packs a long list of exciting new features for the block editor. For example:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.5/block-patterns.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3>Block patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New block patterns make it simple and fun to create complex, beautiful layouts, using combinations of text and media that you can mix and match to fit your story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will also find block patterns in a wide variety of plugins and themes, with more added all the time. Pick any of them from a single place — just click and go!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3>The new block directory</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Now it’s easier than ever to find the block you need. The new block directory is built right into the block editor, so you can install new block types to your site without ever leaving the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Inline image editing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Crop, rotate, and zoom your photos right from the image block. If you spend a lot of time on images, this could save you hours!</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/5.5/inline-image-editing.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3>And so much more.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The highlights above are a tiny fraction of the new block editor features you’ve just installed. Open the block editor and enjoy!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-white-background-color has-background\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:96%\">\n<h2>Accessibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every release adds improvements to the accessible publishing experience, and that remains true for WordPress 5.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you can copy links in media screens and modal dialogs with a button, instead of trying to highlight a line of text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also move meta boxes with the keyboard, and edit images in WordPress with your assistive device, as it can read you the instructions in the image editor.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-black-color has-text-color has-background\" style=\"background-color:#ebcd3d\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:96%\">\n<h2>For developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>5.5 also brings a big box of changes just for developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3>Server-side registered blocks in the REST API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The addition of block types endpoints means that JavaScript apps (like the block editor) can retrieve definitions for any blocks registered on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Defining environments</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress now has a standardized way to define a site’s environment type (staging, production, etc). Retrieve that type with&nbsp;<code>wp_get_environment_type()</code>&nbsp;and execute only the appropriate code.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Dashicons</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dashicons library has received its final update in 5.5. It adds 39 block editor icons along with 26 others.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Passing data to template files</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The template loading functions (<code>get_header()</code>,&nbsp;<code>get_template_part()</code>, etc.) have a new&nbsp;<code>$args</code>&nbsp;argument. So now you can pass an entire array’s worth of data to those templates.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\">\n<h3>More changes for developers</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The PHPMailer library just got a major update, going from version 5.2.27 to 6.1.6.</li><li>Now get more fine-grained control of&nbsp;<code>redirect_guess_404_permalink()</code>.</li><li>Sites that use PHP’s OPcache will see more reliable cache invalidation, thanks to the new&nbsp;<code>wp_opcache_invalidate()</code>&nbsp;function during updates (including to plugins and themes).</li><li>Custom post types associated with the category taxonomy can now opt-in to supporting the default term.</li><li>Default terms can now be specified for custom taxonomies in&nbsp;<code>register_taxonomy()</code>.</li><li>The REST API now officially supports specifying default metadata values through&nbsp;<code>register_meta()</code>.</li><li>You will find updated versions of these bundled libraries: SimplePie, Twemoji, Masonry, imagesLoaded, getID3, Moment.js, and clipboard.js.</li></ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-white-background-color has-background\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:2%\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column\" style=\"flex-basis:96%\">\n<h2>The Squad</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading this release were&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ma.tt/\">Matt Mullenweg</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/whyisjake\">Jake Spurlock,</a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dream-encode.com/blog/\">David Baumwald</a>.

The WordPress 5.5 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-1\">Beta 1</a> came out on July 7, followed by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-2/\">Beta 2</a> on July 14, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-3/\">Beta 3</a> on July 21, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-4/\">Beta 4</a> on July 27. Subsequently, the team also published the first <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-release-candidate/\">release candidate</a> of WordPress 5.5 on July 28.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5, which is slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-5/\">August 11, 2020</a>, is a major update with features like <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-autoupdates/\">automatic updates for plugins and themes</a>, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2020/07/22/proposed-block-directory-guidelines/\">block directory</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/10/merge-announcement-extensible-core-sitemaps/\">XML sitemaps</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/16/block-patterns-in-wordpress-5-5/\">block patterns</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/14/lazy-loading-images-in-5-5/\">lazy-loading images</a>, among others. To learn more about the release, check out its <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/30/wordpress-5-5-field-guide/\">field guide post</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in building WordPress Core?

Version 8.5 &#8211; the last plugin release will be included entirely (without experimental features) in WordPress 5.5, introduced improvements to block drag-and-drop and accessibility, easier updates for external images, and support for the block directory. Version 8.6 comes with features like Cover block video position controls and block pattern updates.

The team has also started working on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/13/reimagining-online-events/\">reimagining online events</a>. Based on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/13/reimagining-online-events/#comment-28505\">feedback from the community members</a>, the team decided to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/moving-forward-with-online-events/\">make changes to the current online WordCamp format</a>. Key changes include wrapping up financial support for A/V vendors, ending event swag support for newer online WordCamps, and suspending the Global Community Sponsorship program for 2020. The team encourages upcoming online WordCamps to experiment with their events to facilitate an effective learning experience for attendees while avoiding online event fatigue. The team is currently working on a proposal to organize community-supported <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/building-community-beyond-events/\">recorded workshops and synchronous discussion groups</a> to help community members learn WordPress.<br><br>Want to get involved with the Community team? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Follow the Community blog here</a>, or join them in the #community-events channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>. To organize a Meetup or WordCamp, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/welcome/applying-for-a-virtual-event/\">visit the handbook page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordCamp US 2020 is canceled</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizers of WordCamp US 2020 have <a href=\"https://2020.us.wordcamp.org/2020/07/30/wcus-2020-an-update/\">canceled the event</a> in light of the continued pandemic and online event fatigue. The flagship event, which was originally scheduled for October 27-29 as an in-person event, had already planned to transition to an online event. Several WCUS Organizers will be working with the WordPress Community team to focus on other formats and ideas for online events, including a 24-hour contributor day, and contributing to the workshops initiative <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/building-community-beyond-events/\">currently being discussed</a>. Matt Mullenweg’s State of the Word (which typically accompanies WordCamp US) is likely to take place in a different format later in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugin and theme updates are now available over zip files</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After eleven years, WordPress now allows users to update plugins and themes by <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/48390\">uploading a ZIP file, in WordPress 5.5</a>.&nbsp; The feature, which was merged on July 7, has been one of the most requested features in WordPress. Now, when a user tries to upload a plugin or theme zip file from the WordPress dashboard by clicking the “Install Now” button, WordPress will direct users to a new screen that compares the currently-installed extension with the uploaded versions. Users can then choose between continuing with the installation or canceling. WordPress 5.5 will also offer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-autoupdates/\">automatic plugin and theme updates</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2020/07/22/proposed-block-directory-guidelines/\">Block directory</a> is coming to WordPress with the 5.5 release. Plugin authors can now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2020/07/11/you-can-now-add-your-own-plugins-to-the-block-directory/\">submit their Block plugins to the directory</a>.</li><li>The Core team has opened up the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/31/wordpress-5-6-whats-on-your-wishlist/\">call for features</a> in the WordPress 5.6 release. You can <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/31/wordpress-5-6-whats-on-your-wishlist/\">comment on the post</a> with features that you’d like to be included, current UX pain points, or maintenance tickets that need to be addressed. August 20 is the deadline for feature requests. </li><li>Editor features such as the new Navigation block, the navigation screen, and the widget screen that were originally <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2020/03/06/update-progress-on-goals/\">planned to be merged with WordPress 5.5</a> have been <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/02/editor-features-for-wordpress-5-5-update/\">pushed for the next release</a>. </li><li>The Theme team is inviting proposals on whether to allow themes to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/07/13/proposal-allow-themes-to-add-a-top-level-admin-menu/\">place an additional top-level menu link</a> in the admin.</li><li><a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2020/07/buddypress-6-2-0-beta/\">BuddyPress 6.2 beta </a>is out in the wild, and the team will soon release the stable version. The update includes changes that will make BuddyPress fully compatible with WordPress 5.5.</li><li>WordCamp EU 2021, which was being planned as an in-person event in Porto, Portugal, <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/wordcamp-europe-2021-will-be-online/\">is moving online</a>. The team is considering an in-person WordCamp EU in 2022. </li><li>The Polyglots team has prepared and finalized a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2020/07/09/translation-editor-locale-manager-vetting-criteria-page-draft/\">Translation Editor &amp; Locale Manager Vetting Criteria</a> to provide more clarity on how global mentors assign PTE/GTE/Locale Managers and to help locale teams set their own guidelines. The document, which was finalized <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2020/07/09/translation-editor-locale-manager-vetting-criteria-page-draft/\">after a lot of discussion</a>, is now available in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/translation-editor-locale-manager-vetting-criteria/\">Polyglots handbook</a>.</li><li>Members of the Community team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/03/proposal-recognition-for-event-volunteers-and-attendees-in-wordpress-org-profile/\">are discussing</a> whether WordCamp volunteers, WordCamp attendees, or Meetup attendees should be awarded a WordPress.org profile badge. The ongoing discussion will be open for comments until August 13.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-notifications/\">WP Notify project</a>, which aims to create a better way to manage and deliver notifications to the relevant audience, is on to its next steps. The team has finalized the initial requirements, and is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/09/wp-notify-next-steps/\">kicking off the project build</a>.</li><li>The WordPress documentation team is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/external-linking-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">considering a ban on links to commercial websites</a> in a revision to its external linking policy. The policy change does not remove external links to commercial sites from WordPress.org and only applies to documentation sites. The idea is to protect documentation from being abused, and to prevent the WordPress project from being biased. Discussion on this post is still ongoing, and a decision has not yet been made. Feel free to<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/external-linking-policy/\"> comment on the discussion posts</a>, if you would like to share your thoughts on the topic. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

This is only <strong>five weeks away</strong>. Your help is needed to ensure this release is tested properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for bugs is an important part of polishing the release during the beta stage and a great way to contribute. Here are some of the big changes and features to pay close attention to while testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Block editor: features and improvements</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5 will include eleven releases of the Gutenberg plugin, bringing with it a long list of exciting new features. Here are just a few:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Inline image editing &#8211; </strong>Crop, rotate, and zoom photos inline right from image blocks.</li><li><strong>Block patterns</strong> &#8211; Building elaborate pages can be a breeze with new block patterns. Several are included by default.</li><li><strong>Device previews</strong> &#8211; See how your content will look to users on many different screen sizes. </li><li><strong>End block overwhelm</strong>. The new block inserter panel displays streamlined categories and collections. As a bonus, it supports patterns and integrates with the new block directory right out of the box.</li><li><strong>Discover, install, and insert third-party blocks</strong> from your editor using the new block directory.</li><li>A better, <strong>smoother editing experience </strong>with:&nbsp;<ul><li>Refined drag-and-drop</li><li>Block movers that you can see and grab</li><li>Parent block selection</li><li>Contextual focus highlights</li><li>Multi-select formatting lets you change a bunch of blocks at once&nbsp;</li><li>Ability to copy and relocate blocks easily</li><li>And, better performance</li></ul></li><li><strong>An expanded design toolset for themes.</strong></li><li>Now <strong>add backgrounds and gradients</strong> to more kinds of blocks, like groups, columns, media &amp; text</li><li>And <strong>support for more types of measurements</strong> &#8212; not just pixels. Choose ems, rems, percentages, vh, vw, and more! Plus, adjust line heights while typing, turning writing and typesetting into the seamless act.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In all, WordPress 5.5 brings more than 1,500 useful improvements to the block editor experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To see all of the features for each release in detail check out the release posts: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v7.5.0\">7.5</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v7.6.0\">7.6</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v7.7.0\">7.7</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v7.8.0\">7.8</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v7.9.0\">7.9</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v8.0.0\">8.0</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v8.1.0\">8.1</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v8.2.0\">8.2</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v8.3.0\">8.3</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v8.4.0\">8.4</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v8.5.0\">8.5</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Wait! There’s more!</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>XML sitemaps</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/10/merge-announcement-extensible-core-sitemaps/\">XML Sitemaps are now included in WordPress</a> and enabled by default. Sitemaps are essential to search engines discovering the content on your website. Your site&#8217;s home page, posts, pages, custom post types, and more will be included to improve your site&#8217;s visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Auto-updates for plugins and themes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/core-auto-updates/\">WordPress 5.5 also brings auto-updates for plugins and themes</a>. Easily control which plugins and themes keep themselves up to date on their own. It&#8217;s always recommended that you run the latest versions of all plugins and themes. The addition of this feature makes that easier than ever!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Lazy-loading images</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/08/lazy-loading-of-images-is-in-core/\">WordPress 5.5 will include native support for lazy-loaded images</a> utilizing new browser standards. With lazy-loading, images will not be sent to users until they approach the viewport. This saves bandwidth for everyone (users, hosts, ISPs), makes it easier for those with slower internet speeds to browse the web, saves electricity, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Better accessibility</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With every release, WordPress works hard to improve accessibility. Version 5.5 is no different and packs a parcel of accessibility fixes and enhancements. Take a look:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>List tables now come with extensive, alternate view modes.</li><li>Link-list widgets can now be converted to HTML5 navigation blocks.</li><li>Copying links in media screens and modal dialogs can now be done with a simple click of a button.</li><li>Disabled buttons now actually look disabled.</li><li>Meta boxes can now be moved with the keyboard.</li><li>A custom logo on the front page no longer links to the front page.</li><li>Assistive devices can now see status messages in the Image Editor.</li><li>The shake animation indicating a login failure now respects the user&#8217;s choices in the <code>prefers-reduced-motion</code> media query.</li><li>Redundant <code>Error:</code> prefixes have been removed from error notices.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Miscellaneous Changes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Plugins and themes can now be updated by uploading a ZIP file.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/26/wordpress-5-5-better-fine-grained-control-of-redirect_guess_404_permalink/\">More finely grained control of redirect_guess_404_permalink()</a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/01/external-library-updates-in-wordpress-5-5-call-for-testing/\">Several packaged external libraries have been updated</a>, including PHPMailer, SimplePie, Twemoji, Masonry, and more!</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-5+dev-notes/\">5.5-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks, breaking down these and other changes in greater detail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, contributors have fixed more than <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;milestone=5.5&amp;group=component&amp;max=500&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=component&amp;col=version&amp;order=priority\">360 tickets in WordPress 5.5</a>, including <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;status=reopened&amp;type=enhancement&amp;milestone=5.5&amp;or&amp;status=closed&amp;status=reopened&amp;type=feature+request&amp;milestone=5.5&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=type&amp;col=status&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=owner&amp;col=priority&amp;col=changetime&amp;col=keywords&amp;order=changetime\">157 new features and enhancements</a>, and more bug fixes are on the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev/\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you’ve found a bug, please post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

Version 8.3 introduced enhancements like a reorganized, more intuitive set of block categories, a parent block selector, an experimental spacing control, and user-controlled link color options. Version 8.4 comes with new image-editing tools and the ability to edit options for multiple blocks.  The block directory search feature that was previously available as an experimental feature, is now enabled for all Gutenberg installations.

The ServeHappy API has been updated to set the minimum acceptable PHP version to 7.2, while the WordPress downloads page recommends 7.3 or newer. Previously, the ServeHappy dashboard widget was showing the upgrade notice to users of PHP 5.6 or lower. This decision comes <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5257\">after discussions with the core Site Health team and the Hosting team</a>, both of which recommended that the upgrade notice be shown to users of PHP &lt;=7.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordCamp Europe 2020 Moved Online</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the success of a remote WordCamp Spain, <a href=\"https://2020.europe.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Europe</a> was held fully online from June 4 to 6.

Scott DeLuzio, the creator and previous owner of the plugin, <a href=\"https://scottdeluzio.com/wp-crm-system-acquired-by-mario-peshev/\">published the news</a> on his blog last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeLuzio originally built the plugin in 2015 after dissatisfaction with the solutions available on the market and having no control over the data, which was hosted on third-party services. He made the plugin available through his brand Amplify Plugins. Since then, his company has shifted focus to add-ons for eCommerce plugins in the WordPress space.  Therefore, he decided to sell his CRM project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peshev began his career as an engineer with enterprise-grade development. He said he was already familiar with CRMs after having worked with them long before he switched to WordPress development. It shaped the focus of DevriX toward small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) and growing businesses using WordPress as an application framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Over the past few years, we&rsquo;ve built a number of integral solutions in-house for our brands &mdash; including our business process management system or our time tracking software,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I stumbled upon a tweet by Scott DeLuzio disclosing the sale of a couple of plugins, I got hooked almost immediately.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peshev described WP-CRM System as being closely aligned with his company&rsquo;s goal, which is to support WordPress-driven businesses given clear metrics for maximum ROI.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s powerful, integrates seamlessly with most form plugins (intercepting leads through Contact Form 7 or Gravity Forms), comes with Slack callbacks when leads come in, provides multiple views for different use cases, and gets the job done through a single, yet powerful dashboard,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Working with an existing customer base is also a great opportunity to refine the rest of our product offerings and work closely with businesses eager to evolve without having to migrate away from WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of WP-CRM System</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For the short term, Peshev said his quality assurance team is doing extensive testing for performance opportunities. It is also testing to see how the plugin can integrate with other popular business plugins. However, the main goal is to push out some usability improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the long term, we will be expanding into several verticals &mdash; adding industry-specific features that better serve groups of businesses, such as accounting firms, creative studios, and event management companies,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The product is customer-led and we rely a lot on existing customers to improve usability even further.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CRM market is becoming more competitive. Peshev said the contract on this acquisition was already signed by the time Automattic publicly announced its <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-zero-bs-crm-considers-rebranding-it-as-jetpack-crm\">acquisition of Zero BS CRM</a> (now <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zero-bs-crm-rebrands-and-relaunches-as-jetpack-crm\">Jetpack CRM</a>) last year. However, he feels like there is plenty of room for growth for both plugins in the space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Larger businesses have to scale with certain constraints in mind &mdash; both from a managerial standpoint, and when it comes to responsibility,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is how startups emerge and quickly acquire certain industries or niche markets. Automattic is known to spread across other business segments, such as the hosting or eCommerce ecosystems. I certainly don&rsquo;t believe it sets the right tone, but I&rsquo;m also not concerned about yet another CRM solution entering the space. In this case, it&rsquo;s a mutual effort toward strengthening the position of WordPress in the SME space, bringing more opportunities to matured businesses, and preventing businesses from &lsquo;outgrowing&rsquo; WordPress as a business platform.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The major player in the CRM market is HubSpot, but it pushes users to an app that is hosted off-site, which is the opposite approach of both WP-CRM System and Jetpack CRM.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peshev said his company used to be a HubSpot agency partner between 2017 and 2019. However, they terminated the partnership because HubSpot&rsquo;s focus was on building an opinionated business ecosystem that was cluttered and incompatible with other solutions. The goal seemed to be to push users toward other CMS-type software that they owned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WP-CRM System feels native to the WordPress user,&rdquo; said Peshev. &ldquo;With simpler sales cycles, it doesn&rsquo;t feel overwhelming. You don&rsquo;t need to spend forever sifting through options and filling out complex forms. WP-CRM System is designed for growing businesses that used to rely on group chats, emails, and spreadsheets, and can&rsquo;t justify the administrative overhead (or pricing) of the giants in the CRM space. The market is indeed saturated, especially outside of WordPress, and segmentation is the best strategy here: evolving a CRM for a specific segment (WordPress users) and audiences (mostly service businesses) in our case, and developing separate extensions for verticals that reach out more frequently.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 18:23:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: MotoPress Acquires Gutenix WordPress Theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103914\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:149:\"https://wptavern.com/motopress-acquires-gutenix-wordpress-theme?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=motopress-acquires-gutenix-wordpress-theme\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2654:\"<p>MotoPress, a theme and plugin shop in operation since 2013, has <a href=\"https://motopress.com/blog/motopress-acquires-gutenix-wordpress-multipurpose-theme/\">acquired the Gutenix WordPress theme</a> and its commercial <a href=\"https://zeguten.zemez.io/\">ZeGuten</a> blocks plugin for Gutenberg. The free theme currently has more than 700 active installs after nine months on <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/gutenix/\">WordPress.org</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MotoPress already has a number of successful niche WordPress themes and plugins but Gutenix fills the gap for a multipurpose theme. It was developed to work well with popular page builder plugins, and includes dedicated starter template libraries for Elementor, Brizy, and the block editor. The theme&rsquo;s commercial upgrades bundle the GutenixPro premium plugin, 30+ starter sites, and the ZeGuten plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>MotoPress is more well-known for its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://motopress.com/products/hotel-booking/\" target=\"_blank\">Hotel Booking plugin</a> and its associated add-ons. The company also develops a block collection plugin called&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/getwid/\" target=\"_blank\">Getwid Gutenberg blocks</a>, which has more than 10,000 active installs and is growing in popularity. Getwid is unique in that the collection is aimed at developers. The plugin comes with a free style kit that includes theme support snippets and CSS classes to accelerate the development process of building custom themes. Its accompanying <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/getwid-base/\">Getwid Base Theme</a> has more than 2,000 active installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though MotoPress is already developing its own block collection and base theme, the company saw value in acquiring a more multipurpose theme aimed at users of popular page builders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&rdquo;Such a multipurpose theme is something we always wanted to create &ndash; but have never had the time resource to invest in such a multidimensional and complex thing,&rdquo; MotoPress CEO Alexander Matienko said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After a fruitful exchange of experiences and visions with the Gutenix creators,I realized one thing.

This release is the first major update to the plugin in over two years and is one of the largest upgrades in its history. The new version focuses on a design system, a new theme builder, and performance improvements. The driving motivation behind this release was to create global design tools, which is a shift from the plugin&rsquo;s roots as a mere page builder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my biggest complaints about <em>builder</em> plugins is that they have often approached design on the individual page level first. However, web design is not about how you can fancy up a page. It is about taking a holistic approach to the overall design of the site. When building single pages, users of such plugins far too often create more work for themselves, much of it better handled on a global scale. One of the cornerstones of development is to not repeat work you have already done. Builder plugins can too easily push those who use them toward such bad habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Design should handle the foundational, global features first. Then, drill down to the atomic level when necessary. Builder plugins have almost exclusively gotten this backward in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor 3.0 seeks to solve this problem by introducing its design system and a new theme builder. The latter is part of its pro offering. The design system is essentially a global style creator and is available in both the free and pro versions. This is a welcome addition to the plugin and should create a solution for those foundational elements that the plugin has been missing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Creating a site with a design system in mind (i.e. style guide, colors, and typography) is how professionals approach building websites,&rdquo; said Ariel Klikstein, the co-founder and CTO of Elementor. &ldquo;For many creators, this is an integral part of building the site as it helps them, their teams, and their clients to align and communicate around a consistent vision.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Elementor team is coming to terms with the principles that have long guided web designers. The goal is to apply these principles to a user interface, breaking outside the confines of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Design system capabilities are among the pillars of building professional websites, as they give the ability to view and control the site elements from a centralized hub and apply sitewide changes to overall colors, typography, and layout,&rdquo; said Klikstein.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Elementor&rsquo;s Design System</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Editing global colors with Elementor&rsquo;s design system.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Elementor is pitching its new design system as revolutionary. However, such design systems have long existed in the WordPress ecosystem. Theme developers have created similar systems for well over a decade, and they have since capitalized on WordPress&rsquo;s built-in customizer to do it in real time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is whether this new system ups the ante, creating a new baseline in which others must compete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will be for users to decide. However, it does offer a plethora of options under its Site Settings menu. It allows end-users to customize colors, typography, and several other elements across the site. Current plugin users will have tools in their hands to do some more amazing things with Elementor, and they will be able to do them in a much more streamlined manner. Ultimately, it should save time and make it possible to update the site over the long term without re-editing old work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not particularly revolutionary, but it is something that should be standard for any sort of visual design system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While it&rsquo;s true that applying global styles was always possible using custom CSS code and themes, in Elementor V3.0 we made these options truly global,&rdquo; said Klikstein. &ldquo;Today they are independent of a theme, plugin, or widget as part of the element-based web design paradigm. The design system features are integrated into the editor workflow, without the need to use a single line of code. This will let the user implement global colors and fonts across any site element &mdash; be it a button, heading, or background. Then, if the user decides to change the color or a font style, he or she can change it once and apply it wherever it was previously placed in the global setting.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>To not mislead readers, note that most themes that have implemented such systems have also not required custom CSS or other code.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the bigger question is whether this new design system will be better than the upcoming <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/handbook/focuses/global-styles/\">global styles</a> feature in Gutenberg and core WordPress. The aims of the two are similar, but WordPress will undoubtedly launch its feature with a much more limited set of options. WordPress will also need buy-in from theme authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Klikstein did not directly respond to the question of how WordPress&rsquo;s global styles feature impacted any decision that went into Elementor&rsquo;s design system feature. However, when cutting through the marketing cruft, he did say, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great to see that Gutenberg/WordPress is also moving in this direction because we believe this is the best way to create consistent and maintainable websites.&rdquo;  He also said this feature was on the roadmap since the plugin&rsquo;s earlier theme builder concept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg may not be much of a consideration for Elementor&rsquo;s development team. They are clearly carving their own path to success and outpacing others in the race to building websites through a visual interface.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 20:35:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Atomic Blocks Rebranded to Genesis Blocks, Migration Path to New Plugin Coming Soon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103809\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:229:\"https://wptavern.com/atomic-blocks-rebranded-to-genesis-blocks-migration-path-to-new-plugin-coming-soon?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=atomic-blocks-rebranded-to-genesis-blocks-migration-path-to-new-plugin-coming-soon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4941:\"<p>StudioPress, which was acquired by WP Engine in 2018, is <a href=\"https://studiopress.blog/announcing-genesis-blocks/\">rebranding</a> its popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/atomic-blocks/\">Atomic Blocks</a> plugin to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-blocks/\">Genesis Blocks</a>. WP Engine also acquired Atomic Blocks in 2018, growing the plugin&rsquo;s user base from 3,000 active installs to more than 60,000 over the past two years. The purpose of rebranding is to more tightly align the block collection with the Genesis brand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We decided to elevate the Genesis brand to be the parent brand for all of our block and theme products moving forward,&rdquo; WP Engine VP of web strategy David Vogelpohl said. &ldquo;While we could have changed the title of the Atomic Blocks plugin, we wanted the slug to represent the Genesis brand so we decided to create a new plugin to achieve that outcome.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unfortunately, in order to get the preferred slug for the plugin, WP Engine has to create a new plugin, instead of renaming the existing one. The company is creating a migration tool to move the plugin&rsquo;s 60k users over to  Genesis Blocks.  &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Based on initial prototypes, the migration path will be automated for most users of the plugin,&rdquo; Vogelpohl said. &ldquo;We believe that migration technology will be available at the end of our next two-week sprint (starting next week), but we aren&rsquo;t able to commit to a date until more work has been completed.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new Genesis Blocks plugin will now be explicitly developed in support of StudioPress themes and the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://studiopress.com/genesis-pro?__hstc=141311597.cfcc56073bf7750c2817e395dcab7eff.1598463759872.1598463759872.1598463759872.1&__hssc=141311597.1.1598463759872&__hsfp=1755708871\" target=\"_blank\">Genesis Pro package</a>. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the blocks cannot be used with other themes. Rather, it&rsquo;s more clear to users that the collection is designed to look best with WP Engine&rsquo;s products.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Genesis Blocks contains the same 22 free blocks found in its predecessor but can be upgraded via a Genesis Pro subscription to add more blocks, full page layouts, and pre-built sections. The subscription also includes access to advanced block-level user permissions as well as support for the Genesis Framework and its commercial child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<a href=\"https://cloudup.com/ci12kCBu6zy\"><img src=\"https://cldup.com/0-CWURP7ZY.gif\" alt=\"Pro\" width=\"1198\" height=\"794\" /></a>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Moving forward, all new features will be added to the new Genesis Blocks plugin, while support for Atomic Blocks gets scaled back to security releases and updates necessary for compatibility with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpdavidv\"></a>In time, it will be deprecated, but only after enough users have migrated over,&rdquo; Vogelpohl said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have a date for that yet and any future decisions will be based on the percentage of people who have migrated and the effects of that decision on the users who have not migrated at that time. It&rsquo;s important for us to make decisions that are respectful of the users of any of our products and the sites they manage. We will clearly communicate future plans and dates for deprecation, but for now, users of Atomic Blocks will have plenty of time to migrate. We will continue to update Atomic Blocks for security releases and functionality relative to updates in WordPress until the plugin is officially wound down.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When WP Engine acquired StudioPress and the Genesis Framework, the company said it planned to integrate it tightly into the the WP Engine Digital Experience Platform so it performs better there than anywhere else. It&rsquo;s an interesting trend among WordPress hosting companies, similar to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-themebeans-coblocks-block-gallery-and-block-unit-tests\">GoDaddy&rsquo;s acquisition of CoBlocks and Themebeans</a>, where the company is gradually refining its product acquisitions to provide its own flavor or &ldquo;experience&rdquo; of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine also plans to rebrand the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-lab/\">Block Lab</a> plugin as Genesis Custom Blocks. The plugin will also have a similar migration path for its 8,000 active installs. WP Engine&rsquo;s goal with the rebranding effort is to make page building with the block editor more streamlined, as well as an extension of its current product lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Genesis Blocks will play a big role in how we deliver value under Full Site Editing in the future, so this is the first step in helping the Genesis community and anyone in WordPress build better sites faster with the block editor,&rdquo; Vogelpohl said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 00:41:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: WordPress Should Bump PHP Support on a Transparent and Predictable Schedule\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103828\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:215:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-should-bump-php-support-on-a-transparent-and-predictable-schedule?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-should-bump-php-support-on-a-transparent-and-predictable-schedule\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4504:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Juliette Reinders Folmer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/24/proposal-dropping-support-for-old-php-versions-via-a-fixed-schedule/\">released a proposal</a> for WordPress to drop old PHP version support on a fixed schedule. She wrote the proposal after Matt Mullenweg, WordPress co-founder and project lead, reached out to discuss solutions. This was after he closed a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51043\">Trac ticket</a> last week that sought to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/no-minimum-php-version-bump-this-year-wordpress-to-support-php-5-6-for-a-while-longer\">drop support for PHP 5.6</a> and bump the minimum version to 7.1 for the next major WordPress release this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal lays out a position that many in the WordPress community could get behind. It is a clear-cut, transparent path for the platform&rsquo;s future PHP support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folmer essentially put forward two roadmaps in the proposal. The first roadmap decides at what stage WordPress would drop support for a particular PHP version. The platform would remove support for a PHP minor release that is more than five years old each December. This would coincide with whatever major release of WordPress is upcoming. The following schedule lays out the minimum-supported PHP version each year:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>December 2020 &ndash; PHP 7.1</li><li>December 2021 &ndash; PHP 7.2</li><li>December 2022 &ndash; PHP 7.3</li><li>December 2023 &ndash; PHP 7.4</li><li>December 2024 &ndash; PHP 8.0</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of the proposal creates a rolling schedule for backporting security updates to WordPress. Currently, WordPress releases security updates all the way back to the version 3.7 branch. If adopted, Folmer&rsquo;s recommendation would support only the previous four years of WordPress releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a change would mean that when WordPress 5.6 is released in December 2020, the WordPress project would be committed to backporting security fixes as far back as WordPress 4.7, released in December 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Folmer also proposes backporting PHP upgrade notices from the site health project to the currently-supported older versions of WordPress. This measure would inform users of PHP version issues before they make the jump to a newer version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overlap of bumping the minimum PHP support into the future and backporting security fixes gives users a potentially huge window of nine years in which they could stay on whatever version of PHP they are currently on. Nine years may seem like a lifetime on the web with its constantly-changing technology, and it was a point of contention from some people in the comments of the post. However, it is a plan of action, something the WordPress community has not had the pleasure of experiencing with regards to PHP support. Developers will undoubtedly argue over the dates and versions, but that is secondary to actually having a predictable timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A fixed version bump schedule is welcome. It puts everyone from developers to end-users to web hosts on the same page. This level of transparency is necessary if we ever intend to move forward without rehashing the same arguments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The system of waiting around to see when a specific PHP version&rsquo;s usage stats drop below a certain percentage just muddies things. The result is typically a long-winded argument that does not move the needle. Each side picks its stats. Each side digs its heels in. And each side has plenty of good points to make. Ultimately, everyone wants the same thing &mdash; to move the entire project forward and use up-to-date tools. However, they always disagree on how we get there. Eventually, the minimum PHP version gets bumped and the community gears up for the next round. It leaves us in a constant state of tug of war between those who want quicker advancement and those who do not want to leave users behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is that no one is ever completely right in these arguments. There is no roadmap to follow. We have no guiding principle other than &ldquo;this has what&rsquo;s been done before.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress needs to set clear expectations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not just a problem with the minimum PHP version &mdash; many want a more-detailed roadmap for the entire project. However, minimum PHP support is one problematic area that we could have a solution for, and Folmer has carved out a path. We need only follow it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 23:08:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"HeroPress: Discovering Your Place\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=3253\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://heropress.com/essays/discovering-your-place/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=discovering-your-place\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8563:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/082120-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: I was incredibly lucky to count myself as one of the happy WordPress business stories.\" /><p>I remember watching a dog I used to have jump without a thought into a river from the edge. I’ve never been someone to do that. I am cautious by nature, considered and ponderous. I plan, ponder, observe, I was always the child that watched and learnt through seeing. My introduction into the WordPress community like so most of my life experiences started with a circling on the edges, a gradual involvement, slowly acclimatising to the waters.</p>\n<h3>From DIY roots</h3>\n<p>It was the time when everyone was creating their own system from scratch, without asking if they could or should. PHP was fresh, smelt like newly baked cookies, delicious, tasty and often insecurely held together with hope, well-meaning wishes. I was riding the blogging community waves happy and fulfilled, yet frustrated by my own solution that was more a wish than an option. My blogging surf board was more a plank of wood well painted, but really close to breaking. Someone casually mentioned WordPress and after trying it, I was sold. This was pretty early in the life of the system we all enjoy now, but it had enough to show me that this was the way forward.</p>\n<p>What truly sold me was how I could customise and theme my site so easily. This really was at that time all I cared about.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With so many events like reboots and online refreshes, sites would change their themes more often than socks.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I could embrace this with the ease of creating a theme. Style switchers were all the rage, I could change my theme as much as I wanted, with pretty minimal effort and leaving my content alone. It also meant I didn’t have to worry about security, which to be honest I avoided incidents previously out of luck over my code.</p>\n<p>Each release saw rapid improvements, bugs were easy to report and whilst I was very much on the edges, I was slowly moving a few more rings deeper into the experience, testing the water as I went. Reporting a bug, asking a question, joining an IRC chat. My contribution circles were increasing as I moved deeper within the project.</p>\n<h3>A timeline of sorts</h3>\n<p>It would be easy to get stuck on small details in this story, the problem is I want to tell as much of my journey as possible and I’ve been lucky it’s been so long so far. The temptation to expand is heavy, so I’ll try and focus on some points over a timeline.</p>\n<p>I am not sure when you say you joined a community, as I noted I sort of circled, dipping my toe in for a while. However, my first self noted contribution would be with the theme team. Working on building the &#8216;core&#8217; of WordPress itself was a hard place to find my start. It was noisy and as I mentioned I needed a quieter on-boarding. Within this space I could work through themes, learn slowly and participate in a smaller group. It was there I stayed for a while, growing my confidence as a contributor.</p>\n<h3>Following my passion</h3>\n<p>Time moved on and my freelance business grew from an acorn to a flourishing seedling and I made a choice to put my full bet on WordPress. By this time I had discovered not only WordPress, but begun to explore more fully BuddyPress too. It was there I found a place to thrive, grow and for a long time find my contribution space.</p>\n<p>Community and specifically enabling people to create, manage and build open source communities, was and always will be a passion of mine. Particularly in this day and age, the potential for empowerment from this type of software can’t be ignored. I count myself lucky to have been able to focus on this for the time I did.</p>\n<h3>Growing achievements with help</h3>\n<p>My passions were growing along with my business thanks to this project. It was incredible to not only run my own company, but thrive in this space and grow in confidence. I began to travel to WordCamps, speak at them, make connections and then in leaps and bounds grow my business. This continued for a number of years. I was incredibly lucky to count myself as one of the happy WordPress business stories.</p>\n<p>I got to focus on communities and as a result got to write a book about BuddyPress theme development.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Writing a book was powerful for me as a dyslexic.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Whilst not uncommon, for someone who is, writing a book can feel like quite a mountain and you likely are told you won’t achieve that at some point in your life. Never tell anyone they won’t do anything, because there’s a strong possibility given the chance they will, try giving them the opportunity instead.</p>\n<p>WordPress has given me some incredible opportunities in life and I count writing a book as one of them. I didn’t do it by myself though, just like I haven’t done anything in this community alone. I got to write through networking, connections, the people I met. Without the community, I wouldn’t have had the business or written the book. Behind every publication is the community, the network that helped create it.</p>\n<h3>WordPress has given me options</h3>\n<p>One thing this story so far hasn’t covered is the personal side of my life. It’s told you my WordPress journey, yet the tale of any person always has a personal side. Every single commit, every single contribution has a heart, a life behind it. Each contribution has their own ebbs and flows.</p>\n<p>Talking about myself isn’t easy because well I have a lot of privilege and right now in this world I know I am so very lucky to work remote, to have the job I do. Being able to be a full time contributor has given me a quality of life and empowerment I daily am grateful for.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It meant I could be the sole earner when my partner was too ill to work.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s allowed us to move to the best location for medical care and support. I am not unique, so many contributors care, support and hold up so many others. It’s not just the contributor behind the contribution, it’s their families, those that depend on them.</p>\n<h3>Trying on contribution hats</h3>\n<p>If someone asks me where they should contribute, I always suggest they try a number of areas. This is motivated by my own journey. Your place can also change depending on where you are in your contribution adventure, mine did. Just because you enter one area, that doesn’t mean you should stay there. Often the project is enriched by you moving around, spreading your skills and activating. You have to go where you both are the most comfortable and effective, this could be a surprising place to you and others.</p>\n<p>A lot of the new contribution hurdles that once existed have been lowered, however for anyone joining it’s never easy. Remembering those first steps every single one of us took is crucial to keep projects alive. Once you forget how hard contribution is, you set yourself up to not have contributions.</p>\n<h3>You got this</h3>\n<p>If I could time travel there is probably a whole lot I’d do. In relation to my WordPress journey, if I could travel back through the many years to me as I click that first download of WordPress, I’d probably say this quote which I think is attributed to Winnie the Pooh.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“You’re braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.”</p>\n<p><small>― </small><span class=\"authorOrTitle\"><small> A. A. Milne</small><br />\n</span></p></blockquote>\n<p>It’s so easy for us all to think we aren’t good enough. We can’t contribute. We can’t make a difference. We will never find our place. Nobody will ever want us in their project. I can’t lead. I am not good enough to be a team rep. I can’t speak on stage. I can’t lead a release. I can’t be a committer. A designer can’t write code. Sound familiar? I am sure one of those comments you’ve said to yourself, I’ve said them all to myself.</p>\n<p>Maybe in this complicated year, we all should take a moment to be a little gentler, kinder and more compassionate to ourselves. Take a moment to recognise that you can contribute, you can make a difference.. and you do.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/discovering-your-place/\">Discovering Your Place</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 09:00:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Tammie Lister\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"WPTavern: Privacy-First Gravatar Replacement, Pixel Avatars Module Released for the Toolbelt WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103447\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:261:\"https://wptavern.com/privacy-first-gravatar-replacement-pixel-avatars-module-released-for-the-toolbelt-wordpress-plugin?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=privacy-first-gravatar-replacement-pixel-avatars-module-released-for-the-toolbelt-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5538:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Ben Gillbanks decided to put an old idea into motion. After the discussion over Gravatar <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/local-avatars-in-wordpress-yes-please\">privacy concerns and local avatars</a> in WordPress reignited a couple of weeks ago, he went to work building <a href=\"https://www.binarymoon.co.uk/2020/08/pixel-avatars-a-privacy-first-gravatar-replacement/\">Pixel Avatars</a>, a generated avatar solution that requires no connection to a third-party service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gravatar solves a huge problem. It creates a global avatar so that users need to upload an image to only one site and carry it around the web with them. To use the service, sites must pass email addresses back to Automattic-owned Gravatar.com, such as when a visitor leaves a comment. The typical local avatar solution suffers because it forces users to sign up and upload an image for that specific site. Neither option is ideal for every site owner. And, both options tend to add heavily to the page load speed, depending on the number of avatars loaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is where Pixel Avatars come into play. The script has all the privacy benefits of local avatars while maintaining a light footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Initially, I just liked the idea of making dynamic images that can follow you around the internet,&rdquo; said Gillbanks. &ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t even considered the privacy implications of using Gravatar &mdash; although in hindsight they are obvious.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is launching Pixel Avatars as a module in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-toolbelt/\">Toolbelt</a>, a WordPress plugin that he <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/toolbelt-a-new-jetpack-inspired-plugin-with-a-focus-on-speed-and-privacy\">launched in 2019</a>. The plugin is a privacy-focused alternative to Jetpack, another project of Automattic that relies on connecting to a third-party server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The last few years have made a lot of people more aware of privacy online and so I want everything I build to have privacy as a priority,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gillbanks had not put much thought into the Gravatar vs. local avatar discussion until the WP Tavern coverage of it. <em>It is nice to see that we are least in part responsible for some innovative ideas.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is accepted that using Gravatar is how you add avatars to WordPress sites,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;However, Gravatar is owned by Automattic and it has the potential for them to generate a lot of data about what sites people view (comment on), and how popular websites are. I have no reason to be suspicious here. I doubt it&rsquo;s being used in this way, but the potential is there and we&rsquo;d have no way of knowing if it was being used for data collection.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He further explained that he believes Gravatar would be better as an optional plugin. &ldquo;Even a bundled plugin would be better than having it on by default,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In my opinion, the default should be local avatars with a fallback similar to what I have made for non-registered users (or just a blank image). I&rsquo;ve offered my code to the core privacy team &mdash; my plugin is GPL and the <a href=\"https://github.com/BinaryMoon/wp-toolbelt/tree/master/modules/avatars\">code is on Github</a>, so they are welcome to use it if they wish.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Pixel Avatars Feature Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Pixel Avatars are completely local to the site. Using 5kb of JavaScript, which is smaller than a single avatar image on average, the code generates a pixelated avatar. For each user, the plugin creates a hash string using their email address. This method also ensures that the avatar is consistent regardless of what site it is used own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the reasons this is much faster than traditional avatar systems is that the avatars are generated. They are not images that must be loaded, which can be especially problematic when loading a blog post with 100s of comments, each with its own avatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If you use external or local avatars then you will still need to load additional image files and no matter how good your content delivery system (server, CDN, third-party avatar service, etc.), this will mean more data transfer, so a slower page load than my Javascript system,&rdquo; said Gillbanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical perspective, the script is relatively simple. It short-circuits the core WordPress <code>get_avatar()</code> function and returns an HTML canvas element with a unique data property containing the hash of the user&rsquo;s email address. Once the page is loaded, the JavaScript code generates a unique image for each of the canvases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Since I am filtering a core function, this will work everywhere that function is used,&rdquo; said Gillbanks. &ldquo;Comments in the admin, the little avatar in the admin bar, and any other pages or blocks that make use of the <code>get_avatar()</code> function.

The problem was if users drilled down deep enough into web help pages, they could <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mysk_co/status/1296914225718267907\">find a window to escape the walled garden</a>. While this seems like an unlikely way that a user would purchase an upgrade, Apple held the app&rsquo;s updates hostage in order to gain full compliance from Automattic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are a few convoluted ways you can get to our web app from within previews, documentation, etc.,&rdquo; Mullenweg said in the Twitter conversation. &ldquo;We offered to block based on user agent server-side, but that was not deemed sufficient.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Update: <a href=\"https://t.co/aCqKGxE7qL\">https://t.co/aCqKGxE7qL</a></p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1297334622506737664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 23, 2020</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>In a rare congenial response from Apple, the company apologized and reversed course 24 hours later, but not before Automattic had already acquiesced to adding in-app purchases. In a statement provided to <a href=\"https://www.macrumors.com/2020/08/21/wordpress-ios-app-apple-blocked-updates/\">MacRumors</a>, Apple said the issue has been resolved, although it did not specify if this happened weeks ago:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p><em>We believe the issue with the WordPress app has been resolved. Since the developer removed the display of their service payment options from the app, it is now a&nbsp;free stand-alone app and does not have to offer in-app purchases. We have informed the developer and apologize for any&nbsp;confusion that we have caused.</em></p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Official WordPress Apps Need to Be Separate from Automattic&rsquo;s Commercial Interests</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic&rsquo;s control of WordPress&rsquo; official mobile apps has long been a controversial issue in the open source community. Since the company heavily subsidizes the apps&rsquo; development, its agenda for the apps goes completely unrivaled. This is why the official apps contain WordPress.com and Jetpack-specific features that are unnecessary for many self-hosted site owners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the apps are open source, historically, they have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan\">rarely received contribution</a> from developers outside Automattic due to the complexity of the code. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/danroundhill/status/1296941098393190401\">This hasn&rsquo;t changed</a>. In 2016, when <a href=\"https://apps.wordpress.com/2016/08/26/wordpress-for-android-version-5-7/\">version 5.7 of the apps came out for iOS</a> and Android, it looked like Automattic was pushing forward on building <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-for-android-5-7-adds-path-to-upgrade-wordpress-com-plan\">an upgrade path for WordPress.com plans</a>. At that time, features for self-hosted sites began to lag behind significantly. Automattic mobile engineer Maxime Biais said the commitment to support both was equal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;WordPress.com features are not prioritized over self hosted,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When we can implement things for both we do it, but when we can&rsquo;t (like when we don&rsquo;t have the XMLRPC endpoint) we do it for WordPress.com and usually ask Core to do the changes so we can implement the same feature for self-hosted users.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Developing the app for self-hosted users and Automattic&rsquo;s customers at the same time was always a delicate balance. This situation with the App Store underscores the need for the official open source apps to be separate from the control of any commercial entity, but the reality is that these apps would not exist without Automattic. Their continued maintenance is entirely funded by the company. Unfortunately, attracting outside contributions from the broader community has been difficult given that Automattic is the only company whose products are allowed to be built into the official WordPress apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prior to Apple backing off of its requirement for Automattic to add in-app purchases, the company had presumably exhausted every other option before giving in to Apple&rsquo;s demands. At that point Mullenweg started crowd sourcing ideas from his followers on Twitter to look for a way forward for the community. This seemed to mark a new era for the apps where Mullenweg was willing to consider adding other companies&rsquo; products into the apps alongside his own and then passing the revenue along.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;New name: The app has always done a ton of work to support WordPresses hosted anywhere, using the XML-RPC API included in core WP since WP 2.6 was released in 2008,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why we called it &lsquo;WordPress&rsquo; and not &lsquo;WordPress.com&rsquo; or &lsquo;Jetpack.&rsquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I am a big believer in the sanctity of licenses. (Open source relies on licenses and copyright.) We agreed to this license when we signed up for (and stayed in) the app store, so going to follow and abide by the rules. Not looking to skirt it, hence doing what they asked us to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Allow others IAP: All of the code is open source, if other hosts or plugins wanted to support in-app purchases for their plans we could accept patches and have Automattic pass through the revenue.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea of Automattic becoming the arbiter of which companies have access to selling through the official mobile apps introduces even more conflicts of interest into what was already a murky entanglement. This setup would be wholly objectionable to many in the open source community. For the sake of clarity and simplicity, WordPress&rsquo; official mobile apps need to be free from commercial interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John James Jacoby suggested Automattic build a new app for its own products if the company wants to add in-app purchases. Mullenweg seemed open to considering the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We can do that but would probably need to spin up new app under a new developer account, and disable webviews.</p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1296915015845388288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2020</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, given Apple&rsquo;s apology, the liberation of the mobile apps is no longer a matter of immediate necessity. Mullenweg seems satisfied with the outcome for now, but the original conflicts of interest in the app remain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I did not expect the previous tweet to get attention outside the WP community,&rdquo; Mullenweg said. &ldquo;My understanding was the previous decision was final, and we had already made many of the arguments people suggested privately over the several weeks the app was locked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We will continue to be responsive and do our best to be within both the spirit and letter of the app store rules, including closing any webview loopholes that pop up. This also made me appreciate the freedom of the open and independent web.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 23:53:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: New Plugin Displays WordPress Environment Type for Admins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103676\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:179:\"https://wptavern.com/new-plugin-displays-wordpress-environment-type-for-admins?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-plugin-displays-wordpress-environment-type-for-admins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3118:\"<p>One of the minor but useful additions to WordPress 5.5 is the new <code><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/24/new-wp_get_environment_type-function-in-wordpress-5-5/\">wp_get_environment_type()</a></code>&nbsp;function. It makes it possible for plugin and theme authors to do some interesting things based on whether a site is identified as staging, development, production, or some other custom environment type. In discussion on the original trac ticket, Marius Jensen suggested a few ways this function could be useful: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It&rsquo;s a function used for grabbing the current environment, this is to ensure everyone fetches the values the same way (to avoid using different terms and such).</li><li>Outbound emails could be filtered, and if&nbsp;<code>get_environment()</code>&nbsp;isn&rsquo;t set to&nbsp;<code>production</code>&nbsp;then send them to the developer, allowing for legitimate email tests in stage setups without worrying about emails reaching end users.</li><li>API endpoints where you want to use a test endpoint when not in production to prevent data pollution.</li><li>Providing a wp-admin notice for non-production sites so it&rsquo;s much clearer that what you are doing now will/won&rsquo;t affect the site your business relies on.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The new function is already getting put to use in WordPress developer Roy Tanck&rsquo;s new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/display-environment-type/\">Display Environment Type</a>. It adds a prominent red notice to the top of the admin for Production. Custom environment types will be set to blue with a lightbulb icon. (The colors used in the plugin are fixed and not configurable to help avoid confusion across servers.)</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The environment type only displays for admin users. Tankck&rsquo;s plugin also adds the current environment type to WordPress&rsquo; At-a-glance widget:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first plugin on WordPress.org to make use of the new function, but developers are planning to use in other unique ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are adding our own custom environment vars here at Pantheon so plugin authors have the option of doing this but it would be so nice to have this in core so plugin authors don&rsquo;t need to write host specific code,&rdquo; Pantehon developer advocate John Richards commented on the original ticket for the new function.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developer Rene Hermenau said he will be implementing this new concept in his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/\">WP Staging</a> plugin in the next update. WP Staging, which is currently active on more than 50,000 installs, allows users to quickly create an exact copy of their sites for staging or development purposes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com has also <a href=\"https://lobby.vip.wordpress.com/2020/08/20/environment-type-support/\">added support for environment types</a> in VIP Go, allowing developers to run different code for their sites depending on if it&rsquo;s in production, development, or any other custom environment type configuration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 21:16:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: WordPress: A Year in Review, New Project to Fill the WordCamp Void\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103672\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-a-year-in-review-new-project-to-fill-the-wordcamp-void?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-a-year-in-review-new-project-to-fill-the-wordcamp-void\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6439:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Joe Casabona, a freelance web developer and educator, launched <a href=\"https://wpyearinreview.com/\">WordPress: A Year in Review</a> last week. The project was born out of his passion for helping others and a longing for attending WordCamp US, which <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2020-canceled-due-to-pandemic-stress-and-online-event-fatigue\">has been canceled</a> because of the stress of the pandemic and online event fatigue. He wanted to do something to fill in the void.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His goal is to offer online content that members of the WordPress community may have missed out on in the year. The project will provide learning resources in e-book, print book, video, and audio form. The content will be free, but he is asking community members to chip in and sponsor the project, covering the hard costs of putting it together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After WordCamp US got canceled, I started thinking about all of the work that went into it and the amazing amount of content that now wouldn&rsquo;t be created,&rdquo; said Casabona of why he decided to begin this project. &ldquo;I am a big WordCamper and go to between 7-10 per year depending on my schedule, so I&rsquo;ve definitely missed that experience. My main hope is that this can fill in some of the missing content from those canceled WordCamps. I know there are other efforts too, like the workshops the WordPress Foundation is hosting.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What the Project Offers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The plan for the project is to offer three types of content to the WordPress community for free:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>An e-book that reviews how WordPress changed in 2020, including a print edition.</li><li>An interview series with WordCamp speakers.</li><li>A video tutorial series that focuses on new things added to WordPress in 2020.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Casabona plans to run between 15 and 20 interviews with people on a special series via his How I Built It podcast. Instead of a formal talk, he wants to provide interviewees an opportunity to explore their own topics. The <a href=\"https://howibuilt.it/wcus-2020-interviews/\">interview application</a> process is open to those who were scheduled to speak at the canceled WordCamp US through August 31.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The interview series was the first aspect of this project that I thought of,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Basically, I will interview people who applied to speak at WCUS 2020 about their talks &mdash; each episode will have 3 interviewees who have the opportunity to talk for about 10 minutes each about their topic. I&rsquo;ll ask them who they are, what their talk was going to be about, and highlight the main points. I&rsquo;m definitely open to ideas depending on who applies and how many people apply.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Casabona has booked only a few podcast interviews. He said he plans on reaching out to more contributors, depending on how funding goes and the finalized outline for the e-book and videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He got the idea for the e-book from <a href=\"https://www.macstories.net/\">MacStories</a>. &ldquo;Every year, Federico Viticci puts out an iOS review in conjunction with the iPhone release, exclusively for his members,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s such a great resource and feel something like it would really benefit the WordPress community. Since this is the first one I might have some backstory, but it will mainly be a practical reference for people wondering how the popular CMS changed from January to December &mdash; things they might have missed or overlooked.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the e-book goes well this year, he will seek to publish it in the following years. The same would hold true for the printed book, which would essentially be the same as the e-book. A print edition would be a nice keepsake for members of the WordPress community. It is something physical, a tangible item that is not made up of bytes stored on a computer, destined for an eventual digital waste bin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Casabona plans to run 10 video tutorials. He will release one video each week, starting in mid-October, through the end of the year. At the moment, he is planning to run all of the videos himself but may reach out to others who are better-suited for particular topics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The video series isn&rsquo;t a huge departure from the content I put on my YouTube channel right now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m targeting mostly users and implementors, but there were some cool developer additions in 5.5.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Funding and the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The biggest holdup for the project is funding. Casabona has a goal of $3,000 to cover the hard costs, such as transcripts, editing, and out-of-pocket expenses. Those willing to donate can give a custom amount or make a pledge for one of three tiers  with each tier building upon the other:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Support &ndash; $5:</strong> Gets your name in the e-book, progress updates, and behind-the-scenes content.</li><li><strong>Early Access &ndash; $5:</strong> Early draft of the e-book, early access to interviews and videos, and e-book of podcast transcripts.</li><li><strong>IRL! &ndash; $19:</strong> A printed copy of the e-book.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I basically wanted to give the community a chance to pledge and support the project, as well as get a print book if they want it,&rdquo; said Casabona.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is also asking for <a href=\"https://wpyearinreview.com/sponsor/\">sponsors</a> to help fund the project on top of the initial goal of $3,000, which would only cover the minimum to produce content on his own. &ldquo;Sponsorship will allow me to put more of my time and resources into the project,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All of this money is going into production &mdash; the more funding I&rsquo;m able to secure, the more time and resources I can put behind it. For example, this could enable me to hire contributors, editors for each medium, etc.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may be a bit early, Casabona is already thinking about the future of the project and has plans if he exceeds his funding goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Excess funding will allow me to find and pay more contributors and better position the project for 2021,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d also like to set up a fund to send someone who can&rsquo;t afford it to a WordCamp&hellip;once we start having in-person events again!&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 20:09:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:134:\"WPTavern: WordPress Documentation Team Discusses Modifying External Linking Policy Following Opposition to the Ban on Commercial Links\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103625\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-documentation-team-discusses-modifying-external-linking-policy-following-opposition-to-the-ban-on-commercial-links?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-documentation-team-discusses-modifying-external-linking-policy-following-opposition-to-the-ban-on-commercial-links\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4311:\"<p>Last month the WordPress Documentation Team <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-documentation-team-bans-links-to-commercial-websites\">announced a ban</a> on links to commercial websites within the official docs. These include the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">HelpHub</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/\">Code Reference</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/\">Plugin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/\">Theme</a>&nbsp;Developer Handbooks,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\">Block Editor Handbook</a>, and&nbsp;the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/apis/\">Common APIs Handbook</a>. The reason behind the ban was that heavily policing commercial links placed too much responsibility on the documentation team, when they are already working with limited time and resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision was instantly controversial, igniting a heated discussion in the comments. A blanket ban on links to commercial sites, without a clear outline of what that includes, was confusing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t clarity what will/won&rsquo;t be allowed, you state that the rules are expected to change in the future (more lax after some trial and error), and end users lose in the end as a result of excluding&nbsp;<em>actually helpful information</em>&nbsp;because it&rsquo;s&nbsp;free but at a domain that has non-free content,&rdquo; Core contributor Clifford Paulick commented on the ban announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The level of opposition seemed to indicate that there may not have been enough discussion up front and that other branches of the WordPress contributor community, including commercial entities who are also contributors, were not considered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Discussion on [the] external linking policy is going in the way we wanted to avoid,&rdquo; Milana Cap said during the July 13th docs team meeting. &ldquo;I was thinking to explore a different approach.&rdquo; She gave more background on why the team is reconsidering the ban:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The reason we didn&rsquo;t want to allow &lsquo;commercial&rsquo; links is to avoid abuse and make it &lsquo;fair&rsquo; for everyone and not promote any product. We also wanted to save time for our members in a matter of maintenance and sort of automate the process. The further and deeper discussion goes I&rsquo;m realizing this will not be possible. It won&rsquo;t be fair, we won&rsquo;t save time because we&rsquo;ll have to do through discussion every time someone suggest &lsquo;commercial&rsquo; link and I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;ll never come to agreement on what&rsquo;s &lsquo;commercial.&rsquo; Personal blogs, services, products.. all of it is mixed now. So my suggestion is to allow them all, make process transparent and set strict rules about the actual &lsquo;content.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>A Google <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0ipOTmKPShSIMoFuEXnI3gkOOUrPJb9t4HMf30JWC0/edit?usp=sharing\">document</a> is now home to a collaborative effort on a new policy that Cap says is &ldquo;fundamentally different from&nbsp;previous discussions.&rdquo; The new approach proposes a set of criteria for allowing external links, banning things such as product promotion within the tutorial, affiliate links, paywalls, and tracking. The specific criteria and wording of the new policy are still under active discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it pays to speak up, if you have a strong opinion about a decision. Reconsideration of this external linking policy is the direct result of feedback on the initial controversial decision, even after it seemed to be final. This may result in a better solution for all stakeholders involved in this discussion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next week the Documentation Team will be hosting a Zoom call to discuss the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0ipOTmKPShSIMoFuEXnI3gkOOUrPJb9t4HMf30JWC0/edit?usp=sharing\">proposal</a> they have been collaborating on in Google docs.

She had opened the ticket in anticipation of movement on WordPress&rsquo;s minimum supported version of PHP. She had opened it after seeing the plan to no longer support PHP 5.6 in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/13/wordpress-5-6-release-planning/\">WordPress 5.6 release plans</a> (note that initial release plans are not necessarily set in stone).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no denying the symmetry of dropping support for PHP 5.6 with the release of WordPress 5.6. Fate seemed to be calling down, saying that it was time to move past the platform&rsquo;s support of a version that reached End of Life in December 2018. It would be a nice sendoff, a farewell that could usher in a new era of maintaining some semblance of staying up to date with the latest and greatest the programming language has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the excitement was cut short. WordPress developers, especially those who have longed for WordPress to be more proactive in updating its PHP requirements, will have to continue pushing for modernization into 2021. It does not look like it will happen this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress co-founder and project lead, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51043#comment:7\">closed the ticket</a> a few short hours after its opening. &ldquo;Just so we don&rsquo;t cherry-pick stats to make a point, it&rsquo;s worth noting that the PHP distribution across all WP sites we track is the same as when that post was made in 2018: 85% are 5.6 or above,&rdquo; he wrote. &ldquo;Only about 66% are 7.1 and above.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has required a minimum of PHP 5.6 since its version 5.2 release. Of the WordPress installs on versions 5.2 through the current 5.5 only 10.69% of those are running PHP 5.6, according to Sergey Biryukov, a core committer for WordPress. This percentage is even lower than when the team flipped the switch to PHP 5.6+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Given that we&rsquo;re still releasing security updates for WP 3.7 (released almost 7 years ago), it&rsquo;s not like we&rsquo;re leaving PHP 5.6 or 7.0 users without security updates, they just won&rsquo;t have some latest and greatest features of WP 5.6+, which seems fair,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/13/wordpress-5-6-release-planning/#comment-39483\">he said in the comments</a> on the WordPress 5.6 announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is <em>obviously</em> a key philosophical decision that should be made by the project lead,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nacin/status/1296323839379402752\">tweeted</a> lead developer Andrew Nacin. &ldquo;And for what it&rsquo;s worth, our philosophies and standards on this have been consistent for more than a decade. The numbers strongly suggest it&rsquo;s too early to drop PHP 5.6.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there are certainly arguments to looking at the data in different ways, one of WordPress&rsquo;s guiding philosophies has been making the platform accessible to as many users as possible over the years. This has meant taking a slow, deliberate approach while also reaching out to web hosts and users alike. Dropping support for old versions of PHP has not been nearly as fast as some &mdash; including me &mdash; would like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The need for updating the minimum version of PHP is not simply about developers wanting to use the newest and shiniest tools. There are practical concerns. PHP 8.0 is slated for release on November 26, 2020. Regardless of WordPress&rsquo;s minimum required version, it must also work with the most up-to-date version of PHP. The wider the range of versions that the platform supports, the harder it is to test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such is the case with PHPUnit, a testing framework for PHP applications like WordPress. PHPUnit 8 supports a minimum of PHP 7.2.  Technically, it has syntax that requires PHP 7.1 &mdash; hence, the need for the WordPress version bump.  PHPUnit 9 requires a minimum of 7.3 and is necessary for testing PHP 8.0 compatibility. There is an <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46149\">open ticket</a> for solving issues with PHPUnit testing where the team is exploring options to support the range of PHP versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We also need to work on our messaging around these PHP and core upgrades, so we don&rsquo;t cry wolf and cause these notices to be ignored,&rdquo; continued Mullenweg in his explanation for closing the ticket, pointing to the current site health messaging in WordPress. &ldquo;They do not say what version it is currently on. They do not provide a good way to contact the host. They do not give accurate information about security, as most hosts run backports that patch security on older versions separate from what is officially supported by the core PHP project. These are not free upgrades, and I think the cost vs what we are able to deliver to users, vs the hard caused by leaving so many people behind, needs to be seriously weighed. Right now it feels like we&rsquo;re a bit trigger happy on these requirements, and I&rsquo;d even be open to rolling some back.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress may be joked about in &ldquo;real&rdquo; programming circles. Its reliance on outdated tools may be the punchline from developers who are building sites with the <em>Next Big Thing</em>. However, maybe in spite of or maybe because of the platform&rsquo;s reluctance to quickly drop support for older versions of PHP, it has swallowed up 38% of the web. Any project lead would question meddling too much with its leave-no-users-behind formula that was part of the journey getting here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a tough call for a project lead to make. It is also tough because developers like Folmer have put a ton of work into PHP coding standards tools and do the often thankless job of advocating for pushing WordPress into modern-day coding practices.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is in a position where it has some leverage. If the software demands an upgraded PHP experience, it can put its massive user base to work by forcing web hosting companies to cater to their needs. Money talks, and if enough users begin looking for greener pastures, perhaps those web hosts will make some adjustments. That is at least the theory that some in the community share. &ldquo;If there are no consequences to user/host (in-)action, why would they ever bother to take action?&rdquo; asked Folmer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is also a gamble that the WordPress project does not look to be taking, at least for the version 5.6 release.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 20:13:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 4.4 Updates Blocks and Centralizes Coupon Management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103580\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-4-4-updates-blocks-and-centralizes-coupon-management?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=woocommerce-4-4-updates-blocks-and-centralizes-coupon-management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3507:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Yesterday, Automattic <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2020/08/18/woocommerce-4-4-is-now-available/\">dropped version 4.4</a> of its popular WooCommerce plugin. The new release is a minor update with the biggest changes around the plugin&rsquo;s blocks and coupon management in the admin. Two dozen people made 450 contributions to the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce team brought several updates to the plugin&rsquo;s blocks. The biggest user-facing change is that the blocks will now use the WooCommerce thumbnail size instead of loading the full-sized image. This change means that images will respect the product image size settings that users can set via the WooCommerce &gt; Product Images section in the customizer. This change will make sites using blocks more performant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block editor should be slightly speedier with this update. The team removed front end scripts that were not needed from the post-editing screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce also updated its flagship theme, Storefront, yesterday. There is nothing in the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2020/08/18/storefront-2-6-0-release-notes/\">release notes</a> to suggest that the update corresponds with changes in WooCommerce 4.4, but it is a good idea for users to stay updated regardless.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Coupon Management Moved to the Marketing Hub in the Admin</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />WooCommerce Coupons admin screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In WooCommerce 4.1, the team added a new Marketing section in the WordPress admin. When it was initially launched, some users felt like WooCommerce had added a top-level menu item for little more than the purposes of upselling its extensions. The single admin screen also offered links backed to the WooCommerce knowledge base. Many comments on the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/coming-soon-woocommerce-marketing-hub/\">launch of the marketing hub</a> asked the team to reconsider making it a top-level menu item, at least until it offered something more than upsells and links back to the WooCommerce website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having a centralized marketing location in the WordPress admin makes sense for eCommerce websites though. Creating an online shop is only one part of the process. Successful stores need to have a marketing focus, and WooCommerce is seeking to create an experience that helps more store owners become successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is a minor change, <a href=\"https://woocommerce.wordpress.com/2020/07/09/centralized-coupon-management-available-for-testing/\">moving the coupons screen</a> to the marketing hub makes sense. For those end-users who make use of coupons, it should very much be a part of their marketing plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce 4.4 still has the legacy coupons screen beneath the standard WooCommerce menu. However, clicking on the old link will generate an admin notice that migrates users to the new location. The notice provides a button to remove the legacy admin menu item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gary Murray, the Product Focus and Lead for WooCommerce, said the team had larger plans beyond the initial marketing hub in the announcement post. Coupons are merely a second stage in the longer-term roadmap. &ldquo;Think automations, campaigns, customer segmentation, coupon management, marketing focused analytics, and reporting,&rdquo; he wrote.

WordPress has removed jQuery Migrate 1.4.1, but many themes and plugins are now broken because they use outdated/deprecated jQuery functions that relied on the script. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official support forums are inundated with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/search/5.5?in=support_forums\">reports of broken sites</a> after updating to 5.5, as most users who don&rsquo;t follow core development are not aware that jQuery Migrate has been deprecated. Because it&rsquo;s related to jQuery, many of the sites have very visible problems or broken functionality that prevents users from doing things like viewing and editing content. Those who are still using the Classic Editor have been particularly <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/5-5-classic-editor-text-view-add-media-not-working/\">hardest hit by the 5.5 update</a>, since older plugins that hook into the old editor are more likely to be using deprecated jQuery functions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Enable jQuery Migrate Helper plugin has racked up 34 five-star reviews, as it instantly fixes most users&rsquo; problems:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>&ldquo;After updating to 5.5 my hero slider images disappeared and this plugin fixed the problem immediately.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;After updating to WordPress 5.5 my edit a post page and several other things ended up breaking despite having all plugins and my theme updated. This plugin fixed my issue!&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;As a newspaper, not being able to see the content of our posts is a pretty big deal. This fixed it. Thank you.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin gives users time to figure out which themes or plugins are causing the problems and request the authors of those extensions to update them for compatibility with the latest version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One user, David Halchester, reported a problem with a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/navigation-menu-vanishes/\">vanishing navigation menu</a> to the support forums before discovering the Enable jQuery Migrate Helper plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Voila,&rdquo; Halchester said in his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/enable-jquery-migrate-helper/\">review</a>. &ldquo;It worked like magic. My beautiful custom page is working again. That said &mdash; if WP does not want to lose customers, it needs to make sure its updates are compatible with older sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Thank you to the people who created this plug-in. I just saved myself about $300 or more in fees to have someone &lsquo;fix&rsquo; it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He makes a solid point about the plugin saving users&rsquo; money that might otherwise have gone to developers to fix the problem. For those who discover the plugin as a fix, it only costs them the time and frustration of seeking help from their hosting company or volunteers on the support forums. Others who may not be as persistent will likely have to pay for professional troubleshooting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Tadlock published a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/major-jquery-changes-on-the-way-for-wordpress-5-5-and-beyond\">post</a> last week that outlines WordPress&rsquo; three-stage plan for updating jQuery to the latest version.  The plan outlines how a new version of jQuery Migrate will be added in WordPress 5.6 to help users update from jQuery 1.12.4 to 3.5.1 (or later). The tentative plan is to remove the script once more in WordPress 5.7, which is expected in 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, the Enable jQuery Migrate Helper plugin functions as a temporary bandaid. Looking ahead towards the prospect of opt-in automatic updates for major Core releases, which is expected to land in WordPress 5.6, it will be important to consider how wide-reaching these breaking changes can be along to path to updating jQuery, especially for those hanging back with the Classic Editor plugin. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 05:11:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:14;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:26:\"Matt: Second-Order Effects\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=52013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:43:\"https://ma.tt/2020/08/second-order-effects/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1234:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/author/derek-thompson/\">Derek Thompson&#8217;s writing for the Atlantic</a> has been some of the most interesting this year.

The goal was to bring a modern <a href=\"https://wprig.io/\">starter theme and build process</a> to the theme development community. Now, he and the current team are hoping to find someone new to keep the project moving. Whoever is chosen will gain outright ownership of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen will be hosting a <a href=\"https://linkedin.zoom.us/meeting/register/tJ0rc-mhqj4rGtbwM7UB7NL7_bOY50qkMIJ9\">Zoom meeting</a> on Friday, August 21 at 8 am PST. The meeting is planned to last 30 minutes with a possible additional 30 minutes for a Q&amp;A session. He will update the <a href=\"https://wprig.io/news/\">WP Rig blog</a> with the format and agenda for the meeting this week. Anyone interested in WP Rig&rsquo;s future is free to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The ideal candidate is someone who has the interest, time, and drive to keep the project going,&rdquo; said Rand-Hendriksen. &ldquo;Future owners, maintainers, peers, etc. will be expected to adhere to the established <a href=\"https://github.com/wprig/docs/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md\">governance model</a>, which outlines roles, responsibilities, powers, and how to &lsquo;climb the ladder&rsquo; if you will.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before taking the reins, candidates will meet with Rand-Hendriksen and other legacy maintainers of the project. The goal is to sort out the logistics of the handover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Once the project is handed over to new owners and maintainers, the project becomes their project,&rdquo; said Rand-Hendriksen. &ldquo;That means they can take it in whatever direction they feel is meaningful and valuable for the community. This is a true handover: we, the legacy maintainers, are not imposing our view of what WP Rig should be in the future onto the new owners and maintainers. We will impart our knowledge and vision, and let the next generation of the WP Rig team lay down their own path into the future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, the official WordPress Themes Team would take on the WP Rig project or at least its own version of a starter theme. However, the team lacks the resources to make it happen. Some members are interested but no one has the time to contribute to it at the moment, according to Themes Team representative William Patton.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If the TRT wants to adopt the project, they take precedence over all other interested parties,&rdquo; said Rand-Hendriksen. &ldquo;The intent of WP Rig was always to donate the project to the larger WordPress Open Source project, and the TRT would be the ideal group to hand the keys to.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Unexplored Future of Full-Site Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Whoever takes on the WP Rig project will be in a position to explore the great unknown of full-site editing. An early version of the feature is expected to land in WordPress 5.6 later this year. This could mean overhauling the project and taking it in an entirely new direction than originally envisioned. It is a tall order and will require someone with the time and ability to keep up with drastic changes in the coming months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen and the team did some experimental work with <a href=\"https://github.com/wprig/block-areas\">Block Areas</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/wprig/wprig-blockade\">WP Rig Blockade</a>, a variant of the original WP Rig theme that explored blocks outside of the content area. However, the repositories have seen little work in the last year and a half. Rand-Hendriksen said they got too caught up in releasing version 2.0 of WP Rig to see either of those projects come to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As the WordPress community starts exploring what <em>blocks everywhere</em> means, it is more important than ever to have this unifying base to start from so everyone is talking the same language and using the same tools,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When I had to step away, this was my deepest regret: that I wouldn&rsquo;t be part of shaping this next evolution of the platform and wouldn&rsquo;t be able to help the community develop this unifying baseline.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen believes that full-site editing will only be successful with buy-in from the existing theme development community. Without active participation from these developers, full-site editing could split the community into traditional vs. modern theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is a lot of money at stake, and a lot of developers deeply invested in and financially dependent on the status quo of themes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To bring them on board and explore the future of themes, there needs to be a unified baseline to start from, and this is the opportune time to introduce modern code, tools, and standards. WP Rig can be a catalyst for this project and can also be the foundation on which such a project is built. What is it open source evangelists always say? &lsquo;Decisions are made by those who show up.&rsquo; This is a chance to not just show up but actively guide the community into a collaborative future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He feels like WP Rig&rsquo;s new owners will be in a position to answer one of the questions looming over the WordPress project: <em>What should full-site editing look like?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Modern Tooling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WP Rig is far more advanced than the starter themes of yesteryear. However, it is not alone. Of the many starter themes available throughout the WordPress development community, many of them have moved on to include modern build systems and tooling that were not a part of earlier projects such as <a href=\"https://underscores.me/\">Underscores</a> (_s), which is the closest thing to an &ldquo;official&rdquo; starter theme project WordPress has ever seen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When I first came up with the idea of WP Rig, it was because I&rsquo;d been maintaining a very popular LinkedIn Learning (formerly Lynda.com) course on building themes from scratch using _s for years, and I noticed _s and WP themes, in general, were lagging further and further behind the general trends of web development,&rdquo; said Rand-Hendriksen. &ldquo;WordPress themes are by and large still built as if it&rsquo;s 2012, not 2020, and many of the most important advances of the web dev space are not generally in use in theme development. As the project evolved from my personal experiment to a team, we made a decision to start from scratch and say &lsquo;if someone were to build a theme today, in 2018, with today&rsquo;s tools and best practices, what would that look like?&rsquo; The result is a theme building tool using modern build processes and tooling to make theme development easier. Yes, it looks nothing like the standard starter themes, but like I said, the standard starter themes look like the web in 2012.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is still some sentiment within the WordPress community that web development is shifting too far from its roots of understanding the basics of HTML, CSS, and entry-level PHP. Have we moved past the point where those simple foundations were enough to build WordPress themes in the modern world?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Is this harder to understand for beginners?&rdquo; asked Rand-Hendriksen. &ldquo;If you start from the assumption that anything other than the good old way of building themes is &lsquo;harder,&rsquo; then yes, absolutely. If you start from the perspective of WordPress themes being many people&rsquo;s first hands-on experience with web development, and WordPress having a responsibility to introduce people to current and forward-thinking web tooling, then I think the answer is no.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rand-Hendriksen says that WP Rig makes many parts of modern theme development much easier and that the more complex pieces are extensively documented. From performance improvements to modern JavaScript to object-oriented PHP, the theme covers a wide range of practices that old-hat theme developers may need to start coming to grips with, sooner rather than later. &ldquo;For most standard theme development, WP Rig is as easy as with any other dev tool,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is just different from how WordPress themes normally do things. Which from my perspective is not only good but necessary if WordPress themes want to stay current with the rest of the web.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Rig also gives theme authors a leg up with accessibility out of the box. Rand-Hendriksen has long been a vocal supporter of pushing for accessibility standards in themes, so it makes sense that the starter that he spearheaded approaches development with accessibility at the forefront.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve developed themes for 15+ years and taught theme development for over a decade,&rdquo; said Rand-Hendriksen. &ldquo;One of the major roadblocks for theme development is the lack of an official unified tool to start from. _s served that role for a while, but it is now poorly maintained, sluggish in development, and lagging significantly behind where standards and modern tooling is concerned. WordPress needs something similar to <a href=\"https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html\">&lsquo;create react app&rsquo;</a>  has had for a long time. WP Rig was created to serve as a base, or as inspiration, for such a project: provide an official starting theme and build process to give people a unified place to work from and a unified base to contribute back to and improve so the community can lift itself up together.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 19:43:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"WPTavern: Apple to Enforce 1-Year Limit on SSL/TLS Certificate Lifetimes on September 1, 2020, Mozilla and Google to Follow Suit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103455\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:297:\"https://wptavern.com/apple-to-enforce-1-year-limit-on-ssl-tls-certificate-lifetimes-on-september-1-2020-mozilla-and-google-to-follow-suit?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=apple-to-enforce-1-year-limit-on-ssl-tls-certificate-lifetimes-on-september-1-2020-mozilla-and-google-to-follow-suit\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4866:\"<img />image credit: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/author/134\">Sylwia Bartyzel</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Beginning September 1, 2020, Apple&rsquo;s Safari browser will no longer trust SSL/TLS certificates issued for longer than 398 days, which is the equivalent of one year plus the renewal grace period. Apple cited its &ldquo;ongoing efforts to improve web security&rdquo; in the <a href=\"https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211025\">announcement</a> earlier this year. The change affects the full lineup of Apple platforms: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This change will affect only TLS server certificates issued from the Root CAs preinstalled with iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. Additionally, this change will affect only TLS server certificates issued on or after September 1, 2020; any certificates issued prior to that date will not be affected by this change.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple will begin enforcing the change immediately, which means it will deny connections to TLS servers that don&rsquo;t meet the new requirements. After Apple&rsquo;s announcement, both <a href=\"https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/ae4d6809912f8171b23f6aa43c6a4e8e627de784\">Google</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/mozilla/pkipolicy/issues/204\">Mozilla</a> contributors moved to propose their own implementations that cap certificate validity at 398 days. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the major certificate authorities are falling in line, changing their offerings to conform with the new one year limit. This includes CA market leader <a href=\"https://www.identrust.com/sites/default/files/resources/IdenTrust_TLS_%20One_%20Year_%20Max_Validity_June_2020_Communication_0_0.pdf\">IdenTrust</a>, which accounts for roughly <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/ssl_certificate\">52%</a> of SSL certificates. DigiCert, a CA that captures 20% of the market, <a href=\"https://www.digicert.com/blog/position-on-1-year-certificates/\">published</a> a dry note of compliance, emphasizing the burden it places on certificate users:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Why did Apple unilaterally decide to enforce a shorter certificate lifetime? Their spokesperson said it was to &ldquo;protect users.&rdquo; We know from prior CA/B Forum discussions that longer certificate lifetimes proved to be challenging in replacing certificates, in the case of a major security incident. Apple clearly wants to avoid an ecosystem that cannot quickly respond to major certificate-related threats. Short-lived certificates improve security because they reduce the window of exposure if a TLS certificate is compromised. They also help remediate normal operational churn within organizations by ensuring yearly updates to identity such as company names, addresses and active domains. As with any improvement, shortening of lifetimes should be balanced against the hardship required of certificate users to implement these changes.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea behind the change is that certificates with shorter life cycles are more secure, as compromised keys would expire on shorter timeframes. The new one-year expiration forces hosts and certificate providers to make automation a high priority. In fact, this is one of the reasons Let&rsquo;s Encrypt&rsquo;s free certificates already have a short <a href=\"https://letsencrypt.org/2015/11/09/why-90-days.html\">90-day life cycle</a>. It was put in place years ago to encourage automation so that shorter lifetimes are no less convenient than longer ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s Encrypt recommends subscribers renew every sixty days and may even consider recommending shorter lifetimes once automated renewal tools are more widely adopted. This may be happening sooner than anticipated now that Apple&rsquo;s policy is forcing change across the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many WordPress users make use of Let&rsquo;s Encrypt certificates using a plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-force-ssl/\">WP Force SSL &amp; HTTPS Redirect</a> (100k+ active installs), <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ssl-zen/\">SSL Zen</a> (20k+ installs) or <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-letsencrypt-ssl/\">WP Encryption</a> (20k+ installs). Some plugins have automatic renewal built in, but some offer it as part of a commercial upgrade. Others rely on hosts to perform renewals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although most website owners will not need to take action, the shorter certificate life cycle may can become a hassle without automated certificate management in place. It may also affect client billing with different options available from hosts and certificate authorities. If you manage websites for clients whose sites previously relied on certificates with longer life cycles, you will want to make sure to have some form of automated certificate management set up when the change goes into effect.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 23:08:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Exploring the First Block Patterns to Land in the WordPress Theme Directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103449\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:215:\"https://wptavern.com/exploring-the-first-block-patterns-to-land-in-the-wordpress-theme-directory?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=exploring-the-first-block-patterns-to-land-in-the-wordpress-theme-directory\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7623:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For months, I have eagerly awaited the official release of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-5-eckstine-introduces-block-directory-block-patterns-and-automatic-updates-for-themes-and-plugins\">WordPress 5.5</a>, an update that promised to put the long-awaited block patterns system into the hands of theme designers. I may sound like a broken record at this point, but patterns have the potential to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-patterns-will-change-everything\">revolutionize WordPress theme development</a>, even more so than the upcoming full-site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature should drastically change how developers create WordPress themes. If used to its full potential, theme authors can rid themselves of dozens of theme options and drop most of their page templates. They can focus less on programming and more on designing, which is what themes are really all about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand why patterns are so revolutionary, you must understand the underlying issue that it solves for theme authors and, ultimately, end-users. Throughout all of WordPress&rsquo;s theming history, there has been a single overarching issue that has caused untold numbers of issues. This is an issue that has been the root cause of multiple guidelines added to the WordPress.org theme review system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This single issue can almost exclusively trace its roots back to the big question: how can theme authors build custom homepages and easily allow end-users to recreate them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it is a slider or columns of info boxes or a call-to-action section, WordPress has never truly provided a solution that theme authors could rely on. To be fair, many developers have built creative and unique systems around the limitations of the platform. However, those systems were specific to a single theme or a set of themes from a single company. There was no standard. There was nothing that would guide theme designers to simply design whatever interesting thing they had in their minds and allow users to simply fill in the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I say that the homepage of the site is the underlying issue here, the problem is really extended to any page on the site. The homepage design is a bit like the theme author&rsquo;s signature. It allows designers to showcase their talents and draw users in. And for over a decade, theme authors have tried a thousand different methods just to get this one page right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns are so much more. The system does not require that theme authors become PHP ninjas to piece together beautiful designs. It does not limit users to a theme options panel for building their homepage &mdash; they can build out any page on their site with the patterns their themes offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big thing is that it renders the &ldquo;how do I build a custom homepage&rdquo; question moot. Theme authors never need to think about that question again, at least not in the way that they have in previous years. Theming is moving away from building designs on a page level and toward designing individual blocks and sections (patterns). The focus is much more <em>atomic</em>, which provides users with more flexibility and freedom.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I could not wait for weeks or months longer to see what theme authors built within this system, I wanted to take a peek at what the current themes in the official theme directory were doing. There was not a lot to look at, but at least some theme authors are willing to be the pioneers in this new era of theming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/block-patterns/\">Block Editor Patterns</a> feature filter for the directory is not working. Technically, theme authors are not allowed to add the <code>block-patterns</code> tag to their themes, but there is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-check/pull/272\">patch available</a> which should fix the issue soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Patterns So Far</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Right now, the theme directory only has three themes with block patterns. It is not much to go on, but it is interesting to see what theme authors are building so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>UXL Themes recently updated its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/cordero/\">Cordero</a> theme with several blocks. One of the things I like about how Cordero added its patterns is that it created a custom &ldquo;Cordero&rdquo; block pattern category. Patterns can exist in multiple categories, but having all of the theme&rsquo;s custom patterns consolidated to a single group made discovering them much easier. This is a practice that I would like to see more of going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cordero&rsquo;s patterns are primarily geared toward the typical business layout. It includes a couple of hero-type patterns, some features/services boxes, and pricing tables.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Cordero theme block patterns.\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/inclusive/\">Inclusive</a> theme by Themes Team representative Carolina Nymark has several patterns (it is also a solid theme if you&rsquo;re in the market for a good accessibility-ready option). The most interesting patterns of this theme are its two-column patterns with <em>sidebars</em>. Nymark has essentially created the &ldquo;body&rdquo; of a page with patterns. One adds a sidebar on the left and the other pattern adds it to the right. Both patterns have a main column for adding custom content. The sidebar column is decorated with widget-type blocks by default.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Inclusive theme pattern with sidebar and content columns.\n\n\n\n<p>What makes these patterns unique is that they are almost like a stepping stone toward full-site editing &mdash; all that they are missing is a header and footer. Admittedly, I was unprepared for this sort of pattern and expected patterns to be used for smaller sections, but I am a fan of the experimentation in the Inclusive theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nymark has two of the current three themes with block patterns in the directory. Her <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/deejay/\">Deejay</a> theme adds a single pattern, which allows the user to create a DJ profile section on their site. It combines columns, social icons, the latest posts list, a video embed, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Deejay theme profile pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I like the early exploration of this new feature. It is never easy being the first to try things out, so I applaud the theme authors for paving the way. We&rsquo;re only a week into the WordPress 5.5 release, but I am excited to see more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Well Do Patterns Transfer Between Themes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the promises of the block system is that it allows users to switch between themes and maintain their content. The idea is that each theme will style all the blocks in such a way that the front end output does not look broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there is merely a small sample size of three themes, I did hit some content styling issues when switching between them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the more complex a pattern and whether the pattern employs custom classes decides how well it would transfer from theme to theme. Images could present an interesting problem too if the user decides to not replace a pattern&rsquo;s image with its own. Because the image would exist in the theme folder, if the theme is deactivated and uninstalled, it would no longer exist.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 21:24:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.6 Development Kicks Off with All-Women Release Squad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103314\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:193:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-6-development-kicks-off-with-all-women-release-squad?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-6-development-kicks-off-with-all-women-release-squad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4051:\"<img />photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/people-girls-N444PJYUP9\">Brodie Vissers</a>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5 has already been downloaded more than 4 million times after its release earlier this week, and it&rsquo;s time to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/13/wordpress-5-6-release-planning/\">kick off work on 5.6</a>. Josepha Haden will be leading the release alongside coordinator Dee Teal, with additional leads for Triage (Tonya Mork), Core Tech (Helen Hou-Sand&igrave;), Editor Tech (Isabel Brison), Design (Ellen Bauer and Tammie Lister), and several more women managing documentation, accessibility, marketing, testing, and other important aspects of the release. The full squad includes 46 women so far with a couple of roles left to be decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Josepha Haden officially <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/11/all-women-release-squad/\">proposed</a> the idea of having an all-women release squad, she emphasized that this doesn&rsquo;t mean the release can only include contributions from women. In addition to the general objective of shipping a stable and enhanced version of the WordPress, Haden outlined a few more goals for this historic release:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>My hope is that with a release squad comprised entirely of people who identify as women, we&rsquo;ll be able to increase the number women who have that experience and (hopefully) become returning contributors to&nbsp;Core&nbsp;and elsewhere. This doesn&rsquo;t mean the release will only contain contributions from women. And if our current squad training process is any indication, it also doesn&rsquo;t mean that we&rsquo;re asking a squad to show up and do this without support.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/francina/\">Francesca Marano</a>, who worked as release <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-non-technical-release-leads-journey-to-becoming-a-mentor-for-wordpress-core-development\">co-lead for WordPress 5.3</a>, published a post announcing the squad as well as the scope of the release. Two major items are already complete: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13204\">conversion of the widget-editing areas</a> and removal of support for PHP 5.6.x. The squad plans to deliver an impressive array of new features that are still in development:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Navigation menus&nbsp;block&nbsp;in Core</li><li>Automatic updates for major WordPress Core releases (opt-in)</li><li>New features from the block editor upgrades.</li><li>Widgets-editing and&nbsp;Customizer&nbsp;support in Core</li><li>Default theme, including an FSE compatible version</li><li>PHP 8 support</li><li>Public&nbsp;beta&nbsp;of Full Site Editing</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kaydacode/status/1293302599542874177\">tweet</a> from a woman who works as an iOS developer at Quicken Loans, asked if there have ever been women in software development working in leadership roles. Although many projects and organizations have women in such roles for many years (as seen in the replies to the tweet), the question demonstrates why representation still matters. WordPress 5.6 is an opportunity to make many more women leaders visible for people who need to see others like themselves in leadership roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lead developer for 38% of the internet let&rsquo;s goooooo who else is out there <a href=\"https://t.co/bCq8iFdf3I\">https://t.co/bCq8iFdf3I</a></p>&mdash; Helen &#20399;-Sand&iacute; (@helenhousandi) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/helenhousandi/status/1293621808088985602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 12, 2020</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>So far the community has been very <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SergeyBiryukov/status/1294324969133035522\">supportive</a> of the plan for an all-women release squad and is rallying around the idea.

OK, well, it&rsquo;s really a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16020\">10-year-old feature request</a>, but that is <em>age-old</em> in software development years. Should WordPress have a local avatar system?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&rsquo;s be honest. Most of us have kind of gritted our teeth and quietly &mdash; and sometimes not so quietly &mdash; lived with the Automattic-owned properties that are integrated directly with the core WordPress software. At least Akismet is a plugin and somewhat detached from the platform. But, avatars, a feature courtesy of Automattic&rsquo;s Gravatar service, is baked deep into the platform. Users must disable avatars completely or opt into another plugin to distance themselves from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are the obvious privacy concerns that some people have around uploading an image to the Gravatar service and creating an account with WordPress.com. Even aside from such concerns, regardless of whether they are warranted, new users who are unfamiliar with local avatar plugins are essentially guided to create an account with a third-party service to have one of the most basic features expected from a CMS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all WordPress installs have access to Gravatar, such as within companies that use intranets. Some countries have the power to effectively block access to the service, as shown by the move China made in 2013 to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/china-blocks-gravatar-and-wordpress-com-how-to-adjust-wordpress-settings\">block WordPress.com and Gravatar</a>, leaving users to seek out alternatives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The itch that many want to scratch is to simply remove Automattic-connected services from the core software. Gravatar&rsquo;s inclusion in WordPress has hampered any chance of competing services gaining a foothold. To be fair, at the time of Gravatar&rsquo;s initial inclusion in WordPress, there were few good options. It made sense to leverage a working solution that would get an avatar system rolling. And the notion of a globally-recognized avatar is noble &mdash; one service to control your avatar across the web. However, having that service under the control of a for-profit U.S. company will always be an issue that could potentially hold it back from being the service that the web truly needs. It will certainly always be a contentious issue in the WordPress community. Even those of us who love the software and services that Automattic offers can see the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress should be agnostic about what services it includes out of the box. Gravatar should be a separate plugin, even if it is bundled with core <em>a la</em> Akismet. Local avatars is not an insurmountable feature, and it might just be time to make the change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While possible to build into core, it is not a simple matter of plugging in an image upload form on the user profile screen. The feature carries its own privacy concerns too. For example, uploading images currently requires certain permissions that would also provide the user with access to the entire media library. There is the question of how to deal with registered vs. non-registered users in such a system along with several other hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recent chatter in the 10-year-old ticket and the #core-privacy and #core-media Slack channels have <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C9695RJBW/p1593630901357300\">reignited the idea of local avatars</a>.  There is also an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/172jXhfzVFfKfk8M4NXa3e29GlQhZpAaWSxZCrH07_fo/edit#gid=0\">early spreadsheet</a> on local avatar requirements and research.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Much of this discussion is amidst the backdrop of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/04/01/feature-plugin-proposal-wp-consent-api/\">WP Consent API</a> proposal, which seeks to create a standardized method for core, plugins, and themes to obtain consent from users. Presumably, Gravatar usage would tie into this API somehow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg, the co-founder of WordPress and CEO of Automattic, seems open to the discussion. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s exciting to see this older ticket picking up so much steam,&rdquo; he said <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16020#comment:120\">on the Trac ticket</a>. However, he further pushed for a separate featured plugin that focused on broader privacy concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many ways, local avatars feel like the early days of the web in which users had to upload a custom avatar to every single website they joined. At times, it could be tedious. Gravatar solved this issue by creating a single service for people to bring their avatars along their journey across the net. However, we have seemingly come full circle in the last few years.

Remote jobs would become a common practice, spurred on by the global COVID-19 pandemic. A time when everyone would start paying attention to those <em>radical</em> ideas from <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/matt-mullenweg-automattic-corner-office.html\">remote work evangelists</a> such as Matt Mullenweg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question is whether this pandemic was the catalyst the world needed to reevaluate the workplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is certainly a lot of good we can talk about. No hour-long commutes. Saved money by eating at home instead of takeout from the restaurant across the street. More flexible hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a veteran and evangelist of the remote work movement, I have not dealt with many of the struggles that others have during this stretch. While I have had to adjust to the outside world a bit, for the most part, my day-to-day life has remained the same. I had the knowledge that colleagues, friends, and family were having some growing pains with the new reality. However, I never understood what they were going through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, I nearly reached my breaking point. It was one of those times where reality decided to check in. The beautiful veneer hanging over a decade of remote work was stripped away. It was a time where I truly understood what others had been going through during this worldwide period of struggle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of my housemates tested positive for COVID-19 a week earlier. He had a short battle with a fever a few days before, but that was the scope of sickness within the household. My other two housemates and I tested negative and have been doing fine to this point. As frightening as those few days were (<em>Will my friend be OK? Am I going to get sick?</em>), I was unprepared for what this change meant within our household.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That one little test upended our routines and took its toll on my work life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It meant two weeks of continual interruptions from people who are not accustomed to being under quarantine. While everyone did their best, it was not an ideal situation. I could hunker down in my own space, but the routine that typically drives my life was shattered. For those of us routine-oriented people, even the smallest interruptions can feel like a freight train chugging by with the sole intent of ruining an otherwise peaceful day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For most of my professional life, I have worked alone in quiet. I might put on some music or a podcast, mostly as a calming bit of background noise. However, I tend to enjoy being alone with my thoughts and the occasional interruption of a cat jumping in my lap for its daily petting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two-week disruption of my life, while unpleasant, was a mere blip in comparison to the struggle that many others have endured and overcome for the past five or six months. However, it has allowed me to become more empathetic when hearing others&rsquo; stories. From disruptions on Zoom meetings of children zipping through the house to the family dog begging for playtime in the middle of the day, work has taken on a new meaning for many. And, this is true for remote workers within the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic has certainly thrust companies and their employees into remote work. However, I question whether it was the push the world needed to reevaluate the workplace. It is not something that grew organically. It forced people into situations they were unprepared for. Some did not miss a beat. Others are still attempting to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/finding-balance-in-these-uncertain-times-remote-work-and-sharing-our-struggles\">find balance</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many of us with years of experience have run into issues. A large portion of the WordPress community works remotely. Some are new to it, and many who have years of experience are learning to cope with changes to their environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg realizes this is not the best of times, even within an established distributed company such as Automattic.  &ldquo;I believe that if you do distributed work well, you&rsquo;re a lot more productive,&rdquo; he said in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/matt-mullenweg-automattic-corner-office.html\">Corner Office interview</a> for the New York Times.  &ldquo;But the pandemic has affected a lot of people&rsquo;s lives. School is canceled. People are working from home that might not normally work from home. So we definitely have seen a hit to productivity, not to mention the stress, which has been even compounded by the social unrest.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am still an evangelist for remote work. Outside of potentially teaching schoolchildren once again (perhaps in the far, far away future), I can hardly imagine moving to an office away from home anytime soon. However, I can see how being propelled into an unfamiliar environment will not sit well with some. This experience in remote work may even turn away those who would have otherwise been comfortable had they been given the opportunity outside of the chaos of kids, spouses, housemates, and all the other distractions. That old, familiar cubicle may be enticing at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy that this pandemic will make for some converts to remote work but worry that others have not been given a fair look at the benefits that might exist under normal circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This post is in part sharing my struggles with remote work and part an open invitation for members of our community to talk about their experiences over the past several months.  This is me checking in with you, our dear readers.  How are you coping today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For people who are struggling but are not comfortable discussing issues related to remote work openly in the comments, please check out <a href=\"https://www.bigorangeheart.org/\">Big Orange Heart</a>, an organization dedicated to supporting the well-being of remote workers.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 22:27:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: Convert Reusable Blocks to Block Patterns with 1-Click\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103302\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/convert-reusable-blocks-to-block-patterns-with-1-click?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=convert-reusable-blocks-to-block-patterns-with-1-click\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5063:\"<p>Now that <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-5-eckstine-introduces-block-directory-block-patterns-and-automatic-updates-for-themes-and-plugins\">WordPress 5.5</a> has shipped, block patterns are available in core for all users. If you have previously been relying on reusable blocks but prefer the flexibility of block patterns, you may want to convert these. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress core developer Jean-Baptiste Audras has made this possible in the latest update of his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/reusable-blocks-extended/\">Reusable Blocks Extended</a> plugin.

For users who are new to the concept, there are a few distinctions between these similar features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reusable blocks were designed to be a time-saving feature that allows users to save a block or group of blocks for use on other posts or pages. They can be edited but they have a certain distinction in that they are intended to look the same in all places they are used. Any changes made to a reusable block will apply to all instances of the block wherever it is used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a user wanted to make changes to a reusable block specific to one page, the process would involve clicking on the block&rsquo;s properties and selecting &ldquo;convert to regular block,&rdquo; which would ensure that all edits would appear only on that specific instance of the block. It&rsquo;s unlikely that most users would know how to do this without help, so this is one of the drawbacks of reusable blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block patterns are predefined block layouts that are designed to be changed. Once a pattern is inserted into the content, users can customize with their own text, images, alignments, colors, additional blocks, etc. The options are limitless and any changes made are not saved back to the original pattern. Block patterns provide a flexible starting point that gives users an idea of how blocks can be combined to make attractive layouts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>User-Created Patterns Are Coming Soon to the Block Pattern Builder Plugin</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the moment, users can create their own reusable blocks but not their own block patterns. Patterns have to be <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-patterns/\">registered with code</a> in order to appear in the pattern library. This is another reason that Audras&rsquo; one-click conversion is quite useful for users who are limited to capabilities offered in the editor&rsquo;s current UI. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ability to create block patterns inside the editor should be a feature in core. It would enable non-technical users to share their designs and creations in a more flexible format than reusable blocks provide. Until this feature is added to core &ndash; and it isn&rsquo;t a guarantee- there is a plugin for that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Justin Tadlock&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-pattern-builder/\">Block Pattern Builder</a> plugin, which is available on WordPress.org, will soon be merging a pull request that <a href=\"https://github.com/justintadlock/block-pattern-builder/pull/2\">adds the option to create block patterns inside the editor</a>. It will work in a similar way to the process of adding reusable blocks. Now that block patterns are available in WordPress 5.5, this feature will be more useful to a wide range of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Audras&rsquo; <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/reusable-blocks-extended/\">Reusable Blocks Extended</a> plugin, like many other amazing utilities for the editor, might be difficult to find unless you already know exactly what to search. Many times users are not even aware of the possibility of converting reusable blocks to patterns.  This might also make a useful core feature but doesn&rsquo;t seem likely to be a high priority at the moment. In the meantime, watch for more plugins to start extending block patterns to do interesting things now that they are available in core WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 22:12:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: JSHint is Now Free Software after Updating License to MIT Expat\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103245\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:191:\"https://wptavern.com/jshint-is-now-free-software-after-updating-license-to-mit-expat?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jshint-is-now-free-software-after-updating-license-to-mit-expat\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4759:\"<p>The world of open source tooling has expanded to welcome <a href=\"https://jshint.com/\">JSHint</a>, as the project&rsquo;s maintainers have finally completed the necessary work to adopt the MIT Expat license. Previously, the JavaScript linter&rsquo;s code was partially published under the JSON license, with an additional seemingly innocuous clause that stated: &ldquo;The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.&rdquo; This clause prevented it from being recognized by FSF as <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html\">a free software license</a> and similarly was not recognized as <a href=\"https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical\">open source</a> by the Open Source Initiative.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an essay titled <a href=\"http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/jshint-watching-the-ship-sink/\">Watching the Ship Sink</a>, JSHint co-maintainer Mike Pennisi describes how the license hurt the project. Despite having captured the distinction of being the most popular JavaScript linter in 2015, the tool has been brutally outpaced during the past five years by its contemporary, ESLint, largely due to the effects of having non-free licensing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />credit: Mike Pennisi\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Legally-conscious objectors aren&rsquo;t betraying their own dastardly motivations; they&rsquo;re refusing to enter into an ambiguous contract,&rdquo; Pennisi said. &ldquo;Put differently: they&rsquo;re not saying, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an evildoer,&rsquo; they&rsquo;re saying, &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand what you want.&rsquo; This consideration disqualified JSHint from inclusion in all sorts of contexts.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Licensing concerns prevented developers from the Debian and Fedora GNU/Linux distributions from including JSHint. Pennisi even dips into a bit of WordPress history, when he detailed how programming platforms that &ldquo;repackaged&rdquo; JSHint&nbsp;also reconsidered due to its additional clause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There was a time when the popular content management system WordPress repackaged JSHint in this way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Once they learned of the JSON license, they replaced JSHint in a matter of weeks.&rdquo; Pennisi referenced a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42850\">ticket</a> for WordPress 4.9 wherein JSHint was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/01/24/jshint-removed-from-codemirror-in-4-9-3/\">removed from core&rsquo;s implementation of CodeMirror</a>, as well as WordPress&rsquo; build tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When a project like JSHint loses users, it also loses contributors,&rdquo; Pennisi said. &ldquo;This slows the addition of new features and the correction of bugs. Timeliness is important for these things, and people perceive delays very negatively. The best example of this comes from JSHint&rsquo;s delayed support for async functions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JSHint had become what Pennisi described as a &ldquo;bizarrely-encumbered JavaScript linter.&rdquo; Unfortunately, the process of going open source after seven years was not as simple as submitting a pull request for a license change. In a <a href=\"http://mikepennisi.com/blog/2020/you-may-finally-use-jshint-for-evil/\">series of essays</a>, he unfolds the grueling process of requesting permission from all of the project&rsquo;s 200+ contributors, only to end up receiving one refusal and some who weren&rsquo;t available for contact. Ultimately, the JSHint team was forced to rewrite the source code but only for the parts that were contributed by the five people who had not permitted the license change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the beginning of August, JSHint updated to use the MIT Expat license in <a href=\"https://jshint.com/blog/2020-08-02/release-2-12-0/\">version 2.12.0</a> and is now GPL-compatible. Pennisi&rsquo;s cautionary tale of what he called &ldquo;the liberation of JSHint&rdquo; is a fascinating read that details the struggle of overcoming the challenges of the project&rsquo;s original license.  The key takeaway from this story is that software creators should strongly consider the ramifications of licensing up front, even if a large community of users seems unimaginable at first. Open source licensing takes a project further than its creator could ever have brought it alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For many people, licensing is an esoteric part of software development,&rdquo; Pennisi said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a relatable opinion: the legal frameworks are intimidating, and most considerations can be addressed by simply defaulting to well-known free/open-source licenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The trouble is that not all software is distributed under well-known free/open-source licenses. My hope is that the particulars of JSHint&rsquo;s decay help folks understand why licensing matters.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 22:47:44 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: Improved Server-Side Rendering of Dynamic WordPress Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103242\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:181:\"https://wptavern.com/improved-server-side-rendering-of-dynamic-wordpress-blocks?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=improved-server-side-rendering-of-dynamic-wordpress-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4547:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Over the weekend, David Gwyer <a href=\"https://wpgoplugins.com/an-improved-server-side-render-component-for-dynamic-wordpress-blocks/\">announced a custom server-side render component</a> for block plugins. The co-founder of WPGO Plugins primarily built his component to speed up the rendering process for dynamic blocks within his own plugins. However, he has now released this component for other block developers in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most blocks are static. Their output remains the same and has no need to change. However, some blocks are dynamic. Their output needs to change based on a variety of reasons, such as the context they are output in or other changes within the WordPress system. For example, the core Latest Posts block is dynamic because the posts that it displays change as new posts are written. If they were output as a static block, the end-user would need to update the block each time a new post was written. Therefore, dynamic blocks come in handy because they are rendered by the server in the editor and on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with rendering from the server is that it can be slow, especially if the user is making several successive options changes to a particular block. With each change, the block must be re-rendered. The core experience with dynamic blocks has not been ideal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gwyer&rsquo;s new component is <a href=\"https://github.com/dgwyer/server-side-render-x\">available via GitHub</a>. The project has little code, and its primary JavaScript file weighs in at just over 4kb (uncompressed). It introduces a new <code>&lt;ServerSideRenderX /&gt;</code> component, which works similarly to WordPress&rsquo;s existing <code><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/packages/packages-server-side-render/\">&lt;ServerSideRender /&gt;</a></code>. Block developers should have little trouble switching to this version for a quick test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is currently using his component within the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/flexible-faqs/\">Flexible FAQs</a> plugin. After running through a few tests, the plugin&rsquo;s dynamic blocks feel much more responsive, almost to the point where there is little difference between it and a JavaScript-rendered static block. </p>\n\n\n\n<img /> component works when updating a block.\" class=\"wp-image-103253\" />Live rendering when updating a dynamic block&rsquo;s options in the editor.\n\n\n\n<p>He also has plans to use it within his <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-sitemap/\">Simple Sitemap</a> plugin and any other future dynamic blocks. That is assuming WordPress does not improve its server-side rendering component in the meantime.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How the Component Works</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gwyer&rsquo;s component is a fork of the core <code>&lt;ServerSideRender&gt;</code> component, which he says works well aside from the point where it transitions between render states. His custom component seeks to rectify that issue. &ldquo;The main additions were a new piece of state to track the previous block content to use as placeholder content, and a new component prop to handle the spinner location,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He laid out how both the core and his component works with the core component rendering as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Render block.</li><li>Block attribute(s) updated.</li><li>Replace entire block content with spinner.</li><li>Render new block content.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>His new component makes an important change that creates at least a perceived visual speed increase:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Render block.</li><li>Block attribute(s) updated.</li><li>Replace entire block content with placeholder content (current/previous content), plus spinner in the top right corner.</li><li>Render new block content.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Because the block content is essentially left unaltered until the new content is ready to be rendered it looks a lot faster as well as smoother,&rdquo; said Gwyer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real question is whether this fork should make its way into the Gutenberg project and eventually merged into WordPress. WordPress developer Ben Gillbanks thinks so and has created a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/24519\">GitHub ticket</a> with the request.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to see it added to Gutenberg as it&rsquo;s a much better rendering experience for dynamic blocks,&rdquo; said Gwyer. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d happily liaise with the team if they&rsquo;re are interested in including it in core.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 20:49:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: A Non-Technical Release Lead’s Journey to Becoming a Mentor for WordPress Core Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103152\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:243:\"https://wptavern.com/a-non-technical-release-leads-journey-to-becoming-a-mentor-for-wordpress-core-development?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-non-technical-release-leads-journey-to-becoming-a-mentor-for-wordpress-core-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21710:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In the summer of 2019, I was asked to help out with a WordPress release. A few months before, the Core Team representatives reached out to other teams in an effort to increase the diversity of the release teams, and I started seriously considering it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, I was already heavily involved in the WordPress ecosystem and was in my second year as the WordPress Community and Partnership Manager at SiteGround, but I had no experience whatsoever on how WordPress gets done from a Core point of view. Still, when Josepha Haden, WordPress.org Executive Director, pinged me, I said yes without hesitation. And it proved one of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life. Here is how.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Josepha and I walking around Vienna, WCEU 2016 &ndash; Photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/lucasartoni/\">Luca Sartoni</a>\n\n\n\n<h2>An Accidental Contributor: My Path in Tech</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From an early age, I seemed to be predestined to become a developer. My parents are programmers, they started in the sixties, and I got my first personal computer in 1982 when people in Italy didn&rsquo;t really have an idea of what those were.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I followed after their work ethos and I thought that their job was fascinating, making a machine do what you want, but I was drawn to other career options. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t really know what I wanted to do when I grew up, but computers and websites kept being a big part of my personal and professional life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While back-end programming was never something that interested me, I found myself taking a class on web design in 1999, then signed up for a degree in Arts and Multimedia in 2004.  I finally found WordPress in 2008 and started making a living off of it in 2010.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Soon, I realized my true skill was helping clients who were coming to me with a request for a website to better focus on their &ldquo;why&rdquo; for the website and think about their business and marketing strategy before they hired me. I wrote books on business planning, productivity, and websites.  I also started giving talks at WordCamps and other events to educate freelancers on those topics.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, I randomly met some people who were involved in the WordPress community, which led me to start contributing too. I didn&rsquo;t have development skills so I never thought I could contribute to OSS, but it turns out that was unnecessary. I met people who pointed me to the many different teams that make WordPress and started being active in Polyglots first and Community later.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />My first WordCamp Talk: The Rebirth of the Italian Community, at WordCamp London 2016\n\n\n\n<p>I kept working on my business, but the more I contributed to WordPress, the more I wanted to find a way to help thousands of people at a time.  My outreach efforts of giving talks, helping community organizers, and writing content needed to scale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where I met SiteGround.  In the summer of 2017, they were looking for a Community Manager and despite not being one by trade I decided to apply and got the job. Joining the company allowed me to have sponsored time to contribute to WordPress.  It also allowed me to tap into the collective knowledge of my colleagues when I start cooking up new ideas for the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said yes without hesitation, but the truth is that this yes was almost five years in the making. In addition, I felt that Josepha and SiteGround trusted me to do a good job.  In return, I trusted the WordPress community to help me figure out all the things that I needed to learn.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How WordPress Gets Done</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The other encouraging factor was that ever since WordPress 5.0, a release was no longer made by one person, as it used to be for years, or a person with a couple of deputies. Now there was a whole team at work, affectionately known as &ldquo;the squad,&rdquo; so there are many hands on deck.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A Lot of Communication</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>During a release cycle, there is a lot of communication.  There are blog posts from different Make teams. At each stage of the release, there are blog posts in the News section of WordPress.org. There is constant chatter in the public Slack channel and there is a private one which is the safety net for the new people that initially might feel intimidated by asking questions in a large public channel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Different Roles in the Release Squad</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />WordPress 5.3 had a release squad of 12 people and 654 contributors. WordPress 5.5 threw it out of the park with 805 contributors!\n\n\n\n<p>The thing that I love the most about this model for the release is the variety of roles that it includes. There are developers, designers, marketers, technical writers, and project managers. WordPress is not only made of code, and it&rsquo;s great to see all these different skills coming together to contribute to its release.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The role of the Release Coordinator (the one I covered for WordPress 5.3 and 5.4) and of the Triage PM (role that was covered by the excellent David Baumwald for 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5) is to try to keep an eye on all the moving parts. And I say <em>try</em> because it&rsquo;s nearly impossible. This is why there are focus leads for the different parts that are getting worked on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg is the project lead and has been the release lead since WordPress 5.0.  He comes up with the high-level <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/roadmap/\">roadmap</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">focus projects</a>.&nbsp; But beyond that, he is not involved with the day-to-day life of Core development. In over one year of being involved in Core releases, Matt asked only once to add a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/03/03/fullscreen-mode-enabled-by-default-in-the-editor/#comment-38054\">feature</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am annoyed when people think that everything that happens in WordPress is because Matt wants it that way. It diminishes the role of all the people who care about the project and take it upon themselves to move things forward, to shepherd issues, to champion tickets, and in general to commit to contribute to make WordPress better for everyone, no matter if they do it for one ticket or work on it full time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Component Maintainers and Core Committers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A group of people who are instrumental in shaping a release are the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/02/09/what-does-it-mean-to-be-a-component-maintainer-a-refresher/\">component maintainers</a>. They are responsible to look after a certain component that makes up Core and see how tickets in that area are proceeding. They are the ones who can evaluate if a ticket is ready to be merged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once a ticket is deemed ready, Core Committers enter the scene. They do a final review of the ticket. They might request some changes, or make the changes themselves while committing. This is the thing that surprised me the most probably. I really didn&rsquo;t think that a commit could take hours, but it definitely can. In the releases I coordinated, I definitely observed not a lot of engagement from maintainers and committers, and this is very demotivating for people working on tickets. Not everything can go into a release, even if the patch is ready, because there aren&rsquo;t enough people to review, give feedback, and ultimately commit. With few resources, you have to make choices and those will not always align with each WordPress user or contributor preferences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is probably one of the biggest challenges WordPress will have to tackle moving forward: How can we reactivate people who can give a big help?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The Release Party</h3>\n\n\n\n<img />Photo by <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/damndirty/\">Florian Ziegler</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite these issues, things get done and when the release is ready, we celebrate with a party. I don&rsquo;t know who started calling them Release Parties or when they started.  What I know is that for 5.3 and 5.4, I hosted quite a few, and they were all a lot of fun.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the day of one of the steps of the release (it might be Betas, Release Candidates or General Release) the Core channel gets very active: a lot of people come online to see how the version of WordPress gets released. There are multiple steps and different people involved with different tasks. The release steps are documented in the Core handbook and are followed publicly so everyone can see them all.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest party is the general release day; there is one specific moment which is incredibly powerful. WordPress has a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/counter/\">download counter</a>, so before releasing the new version, the squad takes a screenshot of the previous one, we all say goodbye and welcome the new kid. Despite everything being virtual, this moment is almost tangible and will never cease to move me. We made WordPress, once again.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Screenshots of the WordPress counter seconds before WordPress 5.5 was released and two hours later.\n\n\n\n<h2>12 Months as a Core Contributor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While I was writing this article, it occurred to me that I have been a Core contributor for a year now. I still have my full-time role at SiteGround, which at times I found hard to juggle, so I have to give my team credit for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I still can&rsquo;t write PHP and despise JavaScript deeply, but when I look back, I am incredibly proud of the changes that have happened in the past 12 months. I can not take credit for all of them, but I am happy I was able to be somehow part of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Release Schedule</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that a lot of contributors asked for was a mid-term schedule of releases, to better fit them around their work and personal calendar. Being the new kid can be hard because you don&rsquo;t know the whole history and background of why things are done a certain way, but that is also a perk. You are free to restart conversations.  After discussing it with the squad and other teams, it was clear to me that it was just a matter of &ldquo;who is going to bring this up with Matt&rdquo;. And so I did. A couple of days later a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/11/21/tentative-release-calendar-2020-2021/\">tentative release schedule</a> until WordPress 6.0 was published on the Core blog, and we have been using it ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Bigger Release Squad and Mentorship</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The release squad is also getting bigger with every release.  Many teams are involved in making it and affected by it. It&rsquo;s important for all these teams to be represented in the process. In WordPress 5.5, there are several new roles, and in 5.6 there will be even more: Test, Documentation, Support are all vital components of what makes WordPress great, so having their feedback while the software is in active development is important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&rsquo;s important to have mentors.  This is a major improvement that Josepha introduced in WordPress 5.3. The release squad is not only made of focus leads, but there is a growing group of mentors able to help new contributors learn the ropes. The idea is that those people will eventually become mentors and teach new people. This is another great way to have more and more people involved in Core, with different skills and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this brings me to the biggest change (and challenge) of all. WordPress 5.6, which is shaping up to be a massive release, will have a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-names-5-5-release-leads-plans-all-women-release-squad-for-5-6\">squad entirely made of women</a> and people who identify as female. Like a lot of things in WordPress, it all started with a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden/status/1194431234245447680?s=20\">&ldquo;Thinking out loud&rdquo; moment</a> and is now a reality. Work on this release will start very soon, and I am excited to be part of it as a mentor.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Fellow female contributors leading the Polyglots team at WordCamp Torino 2018. Picture by Gianni Vascellari\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"is-style-default\">WordPress Needs Your Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I could say it is all unicorns and rainbows, but it&rsquo;s not. The number of people actively involved in making this project a reality is still very small compared to the magnitude of its reach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am very much a doer, so I wish people took the time and energy they take into critiquing WordPress and turn it into active contribution time. Yes, sometimes it requires being very stubborn about a ticket and it requires to follow up on it relentlessly, but I still think it&rsquo;s worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Active participation also means leaving constructive feedback in tickets or offering to take notes during dev chat.  That is the curse and the beauty of a massive project.  There is always something to do!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, I have also seen an increase in contribution from different kinds of companies. At SiteGround, for example, we mostly contributed to events and the community for years. We sponsored, and we volunteered, we were organizers and speakers. We worked a lot within the Spanish WordPress community to help it develop and grow, and now it&rsquo;s one of the largest in the global community. In the last year, we have increased the hours we dedicate to more technical teams. I am still active in Core as a mentor and as the team representative.  One of our WordPress engineers, Stanimir Stoyanov, is part of the Security team, and one of our JavaScript Engineers, Kiril Zhelyazkov, is now dedicating a couple of days per week to Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />My colleague and Core and Security contributor, Stanimir Stoyanov\n\n\n\n<p>These topics align with our values, so it was a natural progression for us to become more involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, I hope to see people get involved in a proposal I published a few days ago in the Core blog about <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/07/e2e-end-to-end-testing-in-core-working-group-proposal/\">end-to-end tests</a>. Right now there is one, and I&rsquo;m sure we can do better. Again, developers are not the only ones needed. Users are the rarest contributors and probably the ones the project needs the most to finally have some user testing in place. I am not a developer, and I&rsquo;m happy that non-developers can make an impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>My Personal Concerns and Hopes for the Future of the Project</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started contributing to Core, I started a note on my computer with some observations. Not having 17 years of experience in the project helps me see things without bias, and not being a developer helps me see the project more as a living, breathing body, instead of components or tickets. Allow me to share my concerns, hopes, and dreams for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Component Maintainers and Core Committers: You Are Needed More Than Ever</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing this article, the project has about 60 committers and 60 component maintainers, with a lot of people pulling double, triple, and sometimes sextuple duties. But the reality is that in WordPress 5.4 and 5.5 hundreds of commits were made by Sergey Biryukov. I am incredibly grateful for Sergey&rsquo;s work.  At the same time, I feel like we are inadvertently building a bus factor into Core. The majority of the people with Core Commit access did not commit one ticket. Similarly, I reached out to all the component maintainers to hear about their plans for the upcoming releases and only about 50% of the components replied.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we make sure that the people who have the power, and thus the responsibility, to help with committing and shepherding tickets are involved? But also, how do we encourage people to step down and declare themselves inactive so new people can step up?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My career spans over 25 years in different industries, and one thing remains the same: when people see there is someone else filling a role, they will be less motivated and sometimes even intimidated to step up. Scarcity not only drives purchases, it drives new engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Community Team, for example, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/community-deputies/\">maintains a list of deputies and their different statuses</a>. I have been wondering if Core could do something similar so when new people want to step up they can see at a first glance which components are missing maintainers. People who complain about &ldquo;The Core Developers&rdquo; will not see them as a blob, but as individuals who at any point in time might be inactive for a period. When you see that there are actually only a few people actively reviewing and committing, you might be more prone to understand why not every ticket can make it to the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Documentation Is the Highest Form of Generosity</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>I say this every time I speak about contributing to OSS: documentation is frequently lacking. Oftentimes, what is there is outdated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do we make sure that documentation is not an afterthought but is baked into the development process?</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Handbook from it.wordpress.org &ndash; How to translate WordPress to Italian. Photo by Gianni Vascellari\n\n\n\n<p>There is a lot of work put into writing dev notes for the changes that affect development, but that is not the only documentation that is needed. Some of the processes described in the Core handbooks are outdated, some are missing because they live in experienced contributors&rsquo; minds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a big fan of Gutenberg and rich, engaging text, I wish our handbooks would fully leverage the power of the block editor and be more inviting. Right now they are a wall of text and whenever we tell people to look at the handbooks I feel my heart shrinking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Possible solutions, which I am not sure are technically doable, but a girl can dream: sync with GitHub to solve at least the version control issue. Then recruit, recruit, recruit and work with Documentation, Meta, and Design to provide useful, engaging, readable, easy-to-scan handbooks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep Track of the Moving Parts and Work as One</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing that I notice often is how teams, focuses, and components work in silos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is absolutely not done to be gatekeepers, it&rsquo;s just how every team self-organized over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to find a way to have a bird&rsquo;s eye view of what is going into the next release and what are all the moving parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><\\/span> is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported Licen\",\"focal_length\":\"23\",\"iso\":\"3200\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0.076923076923077\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe-300x200.jpg\" data-large-file=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe-500x333.jpg\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1333\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe.jpg\" alt=\"People sitting at round tables during a contributor day\" class=\"wp-image-103206\" srcset=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe.jpg 2000w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe-300x200.jpg 300w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe-500x333.jpg 500w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe-768x512.jpg 768w, https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/People-at-Contributor-Day-WordCamp-Europe-1536x1024.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px\" />People Making WordPress at Contributor Day, WordCamp Europe 2015 &ndash; Photo by Florian Ziegler\n\n\n\n<p>Trac is very granular and you have a number of ready-made reports, you can <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/milestone/5.6\">filter by milestones</a> and see how many tickets are in each component, but that is just part of the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, I am talking about finding a way to manage the project as a whole and not as bits and bobs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Enter GitHub. At Some Point.&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not happening anytime soon, but I hope it will eventually happen. Move development <strong>and</strong> project management of WordPress to GitHub, like Gutenberg has been doing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that for many it will be an incentive to contribute to WordPress in a way that is more familiar. It will lower the bar to entrance, which is always welcome.

The same holds true for thousands of plugins and themes in the official WordPress directories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some, this may feel like a journey back to the mid-2000s, a time when JavaScript very much felt like the Wild West. jQuery solved many issues for a programming language that had not kept up with what developers needed to accomplish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A ticket created by Aaron Jorbin four years ago to <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37110\">move WordPress to the latest 3.x branch</a> of jQuery is finally coming to fruition. However, the WordPress development team will need to make this transition in stages, particularly after waiting for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has fallen behind on keeping jQuery updated. For a platform that routinely suggests that users need to be running the latest and greatest version, it is odd that WordPress itself has not done the same with third-party code that it relies on. WordPress currently bundles jQuery version 1.12.4, a version of the library released in 2016. It is also a version that supports Internet Explorer 6, 7, and 8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Mostly because for the last couple of years the focus has shifted to other/more modern JavaScript libraries,&rdquo; said WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz on why the platform has fallen behind. &ldquo;The number of JavaScript developers that contribute to core is limited, and there is a very high demand.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the long term, he said a future option might be to move the WordPress admin to native (vanilla) JavaScript completely, which is a sentiment shared in the comments on his announcement post to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/29/updating-jquery-version-shipped-with-wordpress/\">update the version of jQuery</a> bundled with WordPress. &ldquo;This would be great,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and at the same time, a very large effort.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Far too many themes and plugins rely on this dated version of jQuery to move any faster. While plugins could choose to overwrite core WordPress&rsquo;s bundled version of jQuery with the latest version, themes have had no such option. The official theme directory guidelines require themes to utilize the core-bundled scripts, including jQuery. There is a good reason for this: for the most part, it ensures compatibility with core and third-party plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, now it is time to move on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Developers and Users Need to Know</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress has a three-stage plan to bring jQuery up to date. The core team asks that theme and plugin developers begin testing their extensions with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-jquery-update-test/\">Test jQuery Updates</a> plugin. This will help them bring code up to date throughout this transitional period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step in this process will be removing the jQuery Migrate 1.4.1 script from WordPress 5.5, which was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-5-eckstine-introduces-block-directory-block-patterns-and-automatic-updates-for-themes-and-plugins\">released earlier today</a>. This version of jQuery Migrate makes older code compatible and helps developers migrate to jQuery 1.9+.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This move will undoubtedly break some plugins and themes. The core team has made the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/enable-jquery-migrate-helper/\">Enable jQuery Migrate Helper</a> plugin available for end-users. &ldquo;It is intended to be run in production on sites that experience jQuery-related problems after updating to 5.5,&rdquo; said Ozz. &ldquo;It works by re-enabling jQuery Migrate and by showing the warnings about the use of outdated/deprecated jQuery functions to site admins.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The long-term goal is to get developers to update their extensions. In the meantime, this plugin should ease some of the problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ozz said the biggest thing developers need to do right now is to make sure they are testing their extensions against WordPress 5.5. &ldquo;Ideally, paying more attention to any old jQuery-based scripts and confirming they still work as expected,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;In almost all cases, the fixes are trivial.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond WordPress 5.5, things will start to take shape. The tentative plan is to update to the latest version of jQuery and add the latest version of jQuery Migrate as part of the WordPress 5.6 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Again, Migrate will be used to help in updating jQuery based scripts, and also as a backward-compatibility &lsquo;fix&rsquo; while plugins and themes get updated,&rdquo; said Ozz. &ldquo;The version of Migrate in WordPress 5.6 will be different, as it will correspond to the latest jQuery version. It will serve the same purpose as when it was added for the first time, but now will help core, plugins, and themes get updated from jQuery 1.12.4 to 3.5.1 (or later).&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third leg of the process will be to once again remove jQuery Migrate from WordPress. This change is tentatively planned for WordPress 5.7, which will not be released until 2021. The end goal is to remove the reliance on Migrate and ship the latest version of jQuery until someday &mdash; perhaps far into the future &mdash; there may no longer be a need for bundling it with WordPress at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Following the best practices and the recommendations of the jQuery team, Migrate should be used as a helper tool, not as a permanent backward-compatibility solution,&rdquo; said Ozz. &ldquo;Ideally, WordPress will be able to do this.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 20:29:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:127:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.5 “Eckstine” Introduces Block Directory, Block Patterns, and Automatic Updates for Themes and Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=103045\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:283:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-5-eckstine-introduces-block-directory-block-patterns-and-automatic-updates-for-themes-and-plugins?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-5-eckstine-introduces-block-directory-block-patterns-and-automatic-updates-for-themes-and-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5681:\"<img />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/08/wordpress-5-5-eckstine/\">WordPress 5.5</a> &ldquo;Eckstine&rdquo; landed today, named for American jazz singer Billy Eckstine. This release introduces major improvements for the block editor and the security of WordPress. It was made possible by the contributions of 805 volunteers (with 38% of them being new contributors.) The 5.5 update is a testament to the stability of WordPress during uncertain times, as well as its unstoppable, distributed contributor base, who continue to get things done despite the pandemic&rsquo;s unique challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress continues refining the editing experience with more than 1,500 updates from 10 releases of the Gutenberg plugin included in 5.5. (The plugin is where all the magic is tested prior to landing in WordPress releases, and features are periodically rolled in.) Some of the most notable changes include <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/matt-mullenweg-and-matias-ventura-demo-new-image-editing-tools-coming-to-gutenberg\">inline image editing</a>, device previews, and smoother block movement with better drag-and-drop, block movers, block selection, and block relocation.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Block Patterns are making their debut in WordPress 5.5, with a handful of default patterns already available in the block inserter. This new feature helps users build pages faster by allowing them to instantly place sets of blocks that are already artfully arranged. We have written extensively about why <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-patterns-will-change-everything\">block patterns will change everything</a> and it will be exciting to see what developers do with them now that the feature is in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Directory Enables Block Discovery and Installation Inside the Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress recently launched a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/call-for-block-plugins-the-wordpress-block-directory-is-open-for-business\">block directory</a> for single-block plugins and users can now search for and install blocks directly inside the editor. Selected blocks are downloaded seamlessly in the background and automatically activated and placed in the content. The advantage is that users don&rsquo;t have to break their workflows in order to install new functionality. Blocks installed via the editor can also be uninstalled from the plugins page in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Search for and Install Blocks from the Block Directory</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Block patterns, combined with the new block directory, will make page building much faster inside the editor by enabling users to quickly spin up layouts and add blocks on the fly.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Security Takes a Giant Leap with Automatic Updates for Themes and Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 5.5 introduces a new UI for enabling auto-updates for themes and plugins. This is an exciting new era for WordPress that brings a higher level of website security while requiring less effort from users. Those who choose to get on the automatic updates train will no longer have to log into their sites and be greeted with a slew of nagging update notices. These updates will happen the same day they are available, so users don&rsquo;t have to check in as often and sites are better protected from plugin and theme vulnerabilities getting exploited.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress uses wp-cron to fetch updates for plugins and themes twice per day. The feature ships turned off by default in WordPress 5.5, so users will need to visit the theme and plugin pages in the admin to enable automatic updates.  The bulk actions menu dropdown now has options for enabling or disabling auto-updates on all plugins, but users can always enable the updates for select plugins if they have any concerns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable updates in WordPress 5.5 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>XML Sitemaps</strong>: WordPress now includes <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-5-to-include-extensible-core-sitemaps\">extensible core sitemaps</a>, and many users will no longer need a plugin for this functionality. This basic implementation was completed in a way that will not impact performance or cause conflicts with other plugins that add sitemaps.</li><li><strong>Lazy Loading Images</strong>: WordPress images will now wait to load until users scroll them into view, speeding up performance, especially on mobile.</li><li><strong>Improved Accessibility</strong>: Metaboxes can now be moved with the keyboard, assistive devices can see status messages in the image editor, copying links in media screens and modal dialogs can now be done with a click of a button, and more.</li><li><strong>Update Themes and Plugins by Uploading ZIP files</strong>: &ndash; Users can now update plugins and themes manually by <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/after-11-years-users-will-be-able-to-update-themes-and-plugins-via-a-zip-file\">uploading a ZIP file</a>, an improvement for scenarios where one does not have server access.</li><li><strong>Final Dashicon Library Update:</strong> The Dashicons project has been <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-dashicons-project-to-discontinue-development-in-favor-of-new-icon-component\">discontinued in favor of the new Icon Component</a>. This last update to the library adds 39 block editor icons and 26 other icons. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For a more technical breakdown of some of the changes under the hood, check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-5+dev-notes/\">developer notes</a> and the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/30/wordpress-5-5-field-guide/\">5.5 field guide</a>. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 19:13:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.5 “Eckstine”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8799\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/08/eckstine/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66620:\"<p>Here it is!

The reason: the theme was breaking the directory&rsquo;s ban on affiliate links. The theme has since been reinstated. However, it has been delisted from the popular themes list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the Themes Team handed down an initial five-week suspension, the story continued to unfold through various channels over the weekend and into the start of the new week. Brainstorm Force, the company behind the theme, <a href=\"https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/87407#comment:4\">argued that it did not violate</a> the affiliate link rule because the theme was simply filtering referral IDs of third-party plugins.  The plugins were technically supplying the links. The company also asked for lenience because this was its first violation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the initial discussion, the Themes Team has reinstated the theme while bumping it off the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/\">popular themes list</a>. The goal is to make sure existing users still have access to updates while providing a method for dealing with guidelines violations, a method that does not go to the extreme of outright suspension. The team also added an additional week of punishment after finding a sixth affiliate-related violation missed in the initial review.  Astra will now be delisted for a total of six weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Astra is not the first suspension of a popular theme over the years. These high-profile suspensions can lead to the loss of thousands of dollars in revenue if the theme&rsquo;s business model relies on traffic from WordPress.org. In 2017, a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-suspended-from-wordpress-theme-directory-300k-users-left-without-updates\">five-month suspension</a> of the Zerif Lite theme left its creators with a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/zerif-lite-returns-to-wordpress-org-after-5-month-suspension-and-63-decline-in-revenue\">decline of 63% in revenue</a>. Zerif Lite&rsquo;s user count was around one-third of Astra&rsquo;s current total.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it will take some time to see the results, being delisted will likely cut into Brainstorm Force&rsquo;s revenue. The theme upsells a <em>pro</em> version of their theme. It is a common <em>freemium</em> model that many theme companies employ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress.org theme review guidelines <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/#selling-credits-and-links\">ban affiliate links</a>. More precisely, the guideline is as follows:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Themes are not allowed to have affiliate URLs or links.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Technically, Brainstorm Force did not directly output affiliate links via its theme. Instead, the theme injected the company&rsquo;s referral ID into affiliate links for third-party plugins when they were active on a user&rsquo;s site. In and of itself, this type of injection is nothing nefarious. The plugins themselves allow for such filtering of their affiliate links, presumably to entice theme authors to make a few dollars by recommending and integrating with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for the Astra theme, the question is whether it violated the affiliate guideline. When the rule was written, the Themes Team was most likely thinking about direct links within the theme and not a scenario where a theme was injecting a referral ID or filtering an existing link from a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the Themes Team, at least two of the affiliate IDs in Astra were for plugins that the theme recommended but did not actually integrate with or support in any way. In at least once instance, the theme automatically updated a database option for the Monster Insights plugin to add an affiliate ID &mdash; automatically updating any database option without user action is generally not allowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regardless of individual opinions on the Theme Team&rsquo;s complete ban of affiliate links, it is not a cut-and-dry situation of simply allowing or disallowing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It is also about needing to understand the legal impact of disclosures,&rdquo; said Carolina Nymark, a team representative. &ldquo;It is not something that the team can take responsibility for, nor look away if authors do not follow it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Astra&rsquo;s Apology and Response</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Sujay Pawar, a co-founder of Brainstorm Force, published an <a href=\"https://wpastra.com/open-letter/\">open apology on the Astra blog</a>. However, this apology post created its own controversy within the community. The current post was not the first apology. Pawar changed his original post and removed some of the earlier promises he made to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to multiple sources within the community and a <a href=\"https://wpastra.com/open-letter/#comment-62065\">comment on the post</a>, he had promised to dedicate 16 hours from one of the company&rsquo;s senior developers to contribute work for the Themes Team. Along with this contribution, he promised to spend 5% of the company&rsquo;s resources toward open source development and to donate to future WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;These last few days have been very emotional for me and the entire team,&rdquo; said Pawar. &ldquo;I have never been in such a stressful situation in my life. As you can imagine, I wrote many versions of this apology and just wasn&rsquo;t sure what was the best way to do it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For some people in the community, changing the post&rsquo;s content seemed suspicious. He had changed it around the same time the theme was reinstated on WordPress.org. However, the issue was likely the result of bad timing. Pawar was forthcoming about having written the original post and later removing parts of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My initial apology did include the specifics of how we are planning to increase our commitment to WordPress, but after more thought, I felt it wasn&rsquo;t the right place to share that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want our contributions to be overshadowed or tied back to a rule violation. We still plan to honor our commitment, and we will release those details in a dedicated post.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pawar has no hard feelings for the Themes Team. For him, it has been a high-stress weekend that he will no doubt recover from. He is attempting to rectify the situation the best he can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have a lot of respect for all members of Themes Team,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They work tirelessly to move the WordPress ecosystem forward. I 100% believe that guidelines must be enforced because it&rsquo;s the only way to ensure that WordPress keeps growing. As one of the most popular theme authors, it&rsquo;s our goal to lead by setting a good example and work together with the TRT to set better standards.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Long Term: Delisting Themes Instead of Suspending</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Themes Team does not have a lot of options when it comes to punitive measures for guideline violations. In a large part, this is the result of limitations of the software in use. The team simply needs better tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The punitive measures the team has right now is suspend it or do nothing,&rdquo; said William Patton, a Themes Team representative. &ldquo;There is no in-between, and in a lot of cases, neither of those two options are ideal. From past experience, I have found that asking authors repeatedly for changes is either ineffective or they fix it but the behavior returns after a short time. Suspension has been quite effective in some cases but it is quite a lot of work for the team to manage and maintain lists or time frames of what happened when and to revisit after a given time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patton said that the threat of suspension without action is ineffective. However, actually going through with suspending a theme often has implications for end-users. In some cases, there may be an urgent security update that users need to get, but the suspension system does not make that easy to manage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is now an <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5362\">open meta ticket</a> to offer theme directory administrators the option to delist a theme. In effect, this would keep a theme such as Astra available in the directory if someone knows the direct URL. It would also allow the theme author to provide updates, such as security fixes, to users without direct approval from the Themes Team. However, the theme would not be available through the popular themes list or search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This offers the team a less drastic option than a full-on suspension and has no negative drawbacks for existing theme users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the team found what they described as a &ldquo;hacky&rdquo; method of essentially delisting Astra. Because the popular themes list algorithm uses the theme&rsquo;s publication date to help determine a theme&rsquo;s popularity, the team changed this date for the theme to push it down the popular list. It is not a perfect solution, but it provided a quick middle ground between doing nothing and suspension, at least until a more permanent solution is in place. It also gives them an early chance to test out the effects such a measure would have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punitive measures have always been a struggle for the team. On the one hand, they do not like to suspend themes for wrongdoing, regardless of whether such wrongdoing was intentional. On the other, they must attempt to provide a fair playing field for all theme authors. Threats of punishment for guideline violations ring hollow if there is no follow-through. It is not an easy position, and team members can quickly become victims of harassment or unwanted private messages from theme developers and outsiders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We had several occasions where theme authors would &lsquo;follow us home&rsquo; with blame and different kinds of suggestions,&rdquo; said Nymark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways the Themes Team has been dealing with this is by using the relatively anonymous &ldquo;@trtmessenger&rdquo; account when suspending themes. This is the route the team took when handling the Astra theme suspension and followup decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team has dealt with attacks toward individual members over the years on various decisions it has made. In many cases, the representative who delivered a particular decision, regardless of their personal role in it, bared the brunt of the negative feedback. Far too often, it was a case of shooting the messenger, and the current reps have found a workable solution for this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is an account that enables messages to be sent without one single person being held accountable for the message,&rdquo; said Patton. &ldquo;It is intended to prevent anyone from getting any negative feedback directly from a decision.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 21:29:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WPTavern: New WordPress Plugins Disable Unsplash CDN\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102767\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:149:\"https://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugins-disable-unsplash-cdn?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=new-wordpress-plugins-disable-unsplash-cdn\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9548:\"<p>In light of the recent conversations about the Unsplash plugin&rsquo;s CDN, several extensions have popped up this week for disabling it. By default, the plugin serves images from the CDN but saves copies to the WordPress media library in case the plugin is disabled or removed. The plugin does not currently have an option to change this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-unsplash-cdn/\">Disable Unsplash CDN</a> is the first to be published to the WordPress.org directory for changing the plugin&rsquo;s default behavior. There are no options or settings &ndash; activating it turns it on. Xaver Birsak, a prolific WordPress plugin author, created it to help users who may experience slower page speed caused by the Unsplash CDN.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve followed the release of the official Unsplash plugin as well the strange one-star rating from Matt Mullenweg which is think is not appropriate,&rdquo; Birsak said. &ldquo;The problem he mentioned was, in addition to the Unsplash license, the fact that images are being served from Unsplash (Imgix) servers. I don&rsquo;t think that this is totally unnecessary from Unsplash as a CDN can serve images much quicker in most cases. For some users this is maybe not the case.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birsak was referencing Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s recent <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/i-wouldnt-recommend-using-this/\">one-star review</a> of the Unsplash plugin, which drew the ire of many plugin developers whose ability to monetize their products can hinge on getting decent reviews. The review called the plugin &ldquo;sketchy&rdquo; and called into question the practice of making the CDN the default:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It&rsquo;s unclear why they want you to use their CDN and make that the default, it&rsquo;s probably to support their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/introducing-unsplash-for-brands/\">new advertising business model</a>&nbsp;and get analytics for it. Running a CDN is expensive, and if you&rsquo;re not paying for it then you are the product. I would not be surprised if Unsplash hotlinked images broke at some point in the future.</p><p>If you want a CDN, you should run one for your entire site, not just certain images from a single source &mdash; in fact having multiple CDNs running at the same time could slow down your site because of the additional DNS lookups.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Birsak said he checked the plugin and found a simple solution for bypassing the hotlinking, which only requires a few lines of code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s so easy, and others may find it useful, I released this plugin,&rdquo; Birsak said. &ldquo;Nowadays with GDPR and the invalidation of the Privacy Shield people are more likely to be concerned about sending data to third party services. So disabling the CDN should at least be an option.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer <a href=\"https://tomjn.com/\">Tom Nowell</a> also created a quick plugin to disable Unsplash&rsquo;s CDN, which is now <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/tomjn/a7036d369d6f8082dd1eb256c651696e\">available on GitHub</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have qualms with Unsplash themselves but I did miss having the option to choose for myself,&rdquo; Nowell said regarding the plugin&rsquo;s CDN default. &ldquo;Rather than argue to add it, I spent a little time and built the plugin, it&rsquo;s only small so didn&rsquo;t take much time. As for the CDN, it&rsquo;s nice to save bandwidth, though for local development it&rsquo;s always faster to switch it off.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Unsplash Plugin Will Not Add an Option to Disable the CDN &ndash; Its API Guidelines Require Apps to Use It</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugins that disable Unsplash&rsquo;s CDN could immediately become obsolete if Unsplash decided to build in an option into the official plugin to do the same. The company has confirmed the team has no current plans to so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The CDN is a feature that dynamically serves the right size and format of image, and includes performance optimizations not available via additional plugins like WordPress.com&rsquo;s Jetpack or most CDNs,&rdquo; Unsplash co-founder Luke Chesser said. &ldquo;We do this to improve the performance of the image loading and allow Unsplash contributors to count the number of times their images have been seen.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to sharing this data with contributing photographers, Unsplash advertisers also need this data to continue getting value from the new <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/blog/introducing-unsplash-for-brands/\">Unsplash for Brands</a> business model. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The total monthly cost in 2019 for the company&rsquo;s image hosting with <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://imgix.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Imgix</a> was <a href=\"https://medium.com/unsplash/what-does-unsplash-cost-in-2019-f499620a14d0\">$42,408</a>, which means Unsplash spends north of $500k per year to serve optimized images via its CDN. Chesser said the cost of the CDN is &ldquo;very low relative to the number of requests and traffic it can serve,&rdquo; given how optimized and performant the image serving infrastructure is. Last year Unsplash sent petabytes of data through Imgix&rsquo;s CDN for 250 million variations of the library&rsquo;s source images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We treat brands as contributors as they also share images on Unsplash,&rdquo; Chesser said. &ldquo;We report downloads and views back to them. So yes, the view and download counts do matter to our business from a monetary perspective, but to be clear, if you take away brands, we would still have this requirement as it&rsquo;s central to growing the library and encouraging more contributors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Providing stats to brands undoubtedly helps pay the bills and keeps the lights on, so it is no wonder the requirement to use the CDN will remain in the WordPress plugin. In fact, this requirement was built into <a href=\"https://help.unsplash.com/en/articles/2511245-unsplash-api-guidelines\">Unsplash&rsquo;s API guidelines</a> in 2018 and applies to all applications accessing the collection:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;<em>All API uses must use the hotlinked image URLs returned by the API under the <code>photo.urls</code> &nbsp;properties. This applies to all uses of the image and not just search results. &ldquo;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, Unsplash received more traffic from its API partners than from the company&rsquo;s own website and official apps. Any successful monetization strategy that hinges on advertising will need to deliver those stats and requiring applications use the CDN in order to use the API is one way to do that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1290739168537001984\">asked</a> what these API guidelines mean for existing WordPress plugins, like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/instant-images/\">Instant Images</a>, that serve Unsplash images without using the CDN. The plugin has more than 50,000 active installations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When we released the updated guidelines we applied them proactively to new apps and worked with developers on a case by case basis over a one year period to consider hotlinking and downloads for legacy apps,&rdquo; Chesser said. &ldquo;Instant Images was built before we made the update to the guidelines and so we exempted them long ago, along with&nbsp;a number of other legacy apps.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instant Images plugin developer Darren Cooney said he will not be adding an option to his plugin for turning on the CDN and declined to comment further on his reasons. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I will say that I think the CDN should be opt-in and it should be more clear what happens on the Unsplash side when the CDN is in use,&rdquo; Cooney said. &ldquo;What is tracked, why it&rsquo;s tracked and what benefit do added views provide the contributors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> When asked whether Unsplash plans to update the plugin to deny API access to sites that have added a plugin to disable the CDN, Chesser said no. WordPress plugins weaponizing themselves against each other is not unheard of, although it is unusual and frowned upon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t do things like that,&rdquo; Chesser said. &ldquo;I think anyone who knows our team and our community will know that we always try to take reasonable actions as we&rsquo;re representing a lot of contributors and a large community. If a user wants to install a plugin to deactivate the CDN but still access the library, they can do that by all means, but we don&rsquo;t want to build, promote, and support that functionality ourselves because it works against our community,&nbsp;our business, and our mission.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is Unsplash is a business, and a business needs to make money. Certainly a company doesn&rsquo;t commission a WordPress plugin from a team of the caliber of <a href=\"https://xwp.co/\">XWP</a> without hoping for a return on that kind of investment. The plugin&rsquo;s setup process makes it effortless for users to connect to the Unsplash API, but there isn&rsquo;t any transparency during this process regarding what data users are agreeing to send Unsplash. The plugin needs to be more forthcoming about the data the CDN collects on views and downloads. This would go a long way towards establishing more credibility with skeptics. Those who are wary of the requirement to use the CDN can use a plugin to disable it or install an alternative like Instant Images. </p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 21:45:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 8.7 Adds Minor Changes, Updates Block Pattern Designs, and Continues Full-Site Editing Work\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102950\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:263:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-8-7-adds-minor-changes-updates-block-pattern-designs-and-continues-full-site-editing-work?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-8-7-adds-minor-changes-updates-block-pattern-designs-and-continues-full-site-editing-work\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5390:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">On Wednesday, the Gutenberg team pushed what was primarily <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/08/05/whats-new-in-gutenberg-august-5/\">minor enhancements and bug fixes</a> to the WordPress platform&rsquo;s primary project. Everyone is mostly gearing up for the WordPress 5.5 release, so we are not seeing any major features dropping at the moment. However, steady work continues on improving the Gutenberg plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 8.7 contains over 30 bug fixes, in which nearly a third were accessibility-related changes. Around half of the new enhancements focused on updating block patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can look forward to several minor enhancements that should improve the editor, such as the Buttons block getting a proper <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24249\">preview in the inserter</a>. The monitoring solution behind auto-saving should also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/23962\">work more consistently</a> with this update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest user-facing enhancement is the change in <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24263\">dealing with invalid blocks</a>. The latest version of the plugin makes the <em>attempt block recovery</em> option the default. This change hides the <em>resolve</em>, <em>convert to classic</em>, and <em>convert to HTML</em> options under the sub-menu (ellipsis button). This is a nice touch and makes the most sense. Attempting to recover a block should generally be the first step when correcting invalid block output.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Pattern Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Updated block pattern designs.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I can now proceed to eat my earlier words of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/decision-time-what-block-patterns-should-ship-with-wordpress-5-5\">frustration with block patterns</a>. Or, perhaps I can praise myself in some small way for pushing the Gutenberg team to up their game. I was unhappy with the abysmal designs that were originally going to ship with WordPress 5.5. The team has taken what was looking to be one of the most disappointing first outings for a feature and turned it into something the project can be proud of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It did not take much. A photo here. A touch of pizazz there. The Don Quixote images and text bring a cohesive theme to the patterns, breathing a touch of life in an otherwise desolate and barren feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;large header with a heading&rdquo; pattern <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24141\">dropped the blinding background</a> gradient and replaced it with an image. The &ldquo;quote&rdquo; pattern <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24140\">now has a face</a> instead of an impersonal icon. Even the &ldquo;two images side by side&rdquo; pattern <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24139\">fits in thematically</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If anything, I am not a fan of the long pattern names. &ldquo;Large header with a heading and a button&rdquo; and &ldquo;three columns of text with buttons&rdquo; do not exactly roll off the tongue. Nor do they make it easy to write about them. I do not wish the pain of typing them out on any support volunteers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least we are working with a somewhat decent set of patterns going forward, and that is enough to be thankful for at this point. I will now await the first theme author to truly impress me with custom patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Experimental Features Update</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Site editor beta.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Much of the work for this release centered on the plugin&rsquo;s experimental features. The bulk of it went toward post-related blocks. At this point, these features are so experimental that even experienced developers outside of the inner Gutenberg circle have trouble following the progress. It is nice to see the continual movement in this area. However, from a user viewpoint, it is not even ready for a quick look. Enable at your own risk. Wait until the product is a bit more polished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I typically enable Gutenberg&rsquo;s experimental features once a month or so. I want to keep up with the progress and not feel out of the loop. Such was the case over the past couple of days as I tinkered a bit more with the full-site editing and demo templates features. I am unsure what I was hoping for. Mostly, I wanted some indication of a bright future &mdash; one that I fully expect to be realized at some point. I wanted to be wowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand why the <em>wow</em> factor is not there. The feature is far from ready. More than that, I know that, as a developer, you have a vision of the finished product in your head, and as the UI is in flux, others cannot see that vision.

If you haven&rsquo;t already, I recommend reading his article. It describes in detail one question I&rsquo;ve been pondering since I originally posted the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/08/05/feature-project-proposal-wp-notify/\">WP Notify feature project proposal</a> almost a year ago now: Will a new notification system for WordPress solve the notification spam, or just move it elsewhere?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer might not be as simple as we think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been building, maintaining, and supporting a number of free, paid, and client plugins for the past five years. During that time I have also been an active contributor &mdash; as much as I possibly can outside of work and my personal life &mdash; to the WordPress open source project. Now that&rsquo;s definitely a drop in the ocean compared to some folks, but whenever I see the mess that can occur when multiple plugins or themes register admin_notices on EVERY SINGLE ADMIN PAGE, it strengthens my resolve in the idea that WordPress needs a centrally managed notification system.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read Justin&rsquo;s article, or you are a plugin or theme developer yourself, you know that the notifications system (aka admin notices, a reference to the WordPress <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/hooks/admin_notices/\" target=\"_blank\">hook that prints these notices</a>) in WordPress is limited at best. We need to be honest with ourselves, however, admin notices was not designed to function as a notification system. Admin notices should really only be used to display useful information to the user about state changes in the system. Messages like when a post has been updated or deleted, or a database upgrade is required. Short, useful, and more importantly, relevant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As developers, we usually look for the root cause of a problem. And in the case of admin notices, the root cause is not the current notification system, or the fact that plugin developers use it for things other than, well, admin notices. The root cause is the fact that there has never existed a mechanism for notifications other than admin notices to be displayed to the user. This means that whenever a plugin developer has needed, or in fact wanted, to communicate with their users, via &ldquo;in app messages,&rdquo; admin notices has been the only way they can do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to let your users know about a new upgrade? Admin notice. Want to ask them to leave a review? Admin notice. Your premium license is about to expire! Admin notice. Hey, we&rsquo;ve got a new sale on our premium products! Admin notice. It all soon adds up to an almighty mess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&rsquo;s the problem with a project like WP Notify. We&rsquo;ve had admin notices, in its current iteration at least, since 2011. That means we have been using it for all our user facing messages now for nine years at least &ndash; nine years of plugin and theme developers using admin notices to send messages to users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have children, imagine telling your nine year old that the way they have been walking is wrong, and they now need to learn a completely new way of doing it. Good Luck!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, as much as it pains me to admit it, WP Notify is not the silver bullet that will magically fix the problem at its core. As Matt Mullenweg pointed out in the comments on Justin&rsquo;s article, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a notification center is the solution to this problem. It may be useful for other reasons, but not that one.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, not having a specific solution for notifications other than those that are necessary, means that developers will keep on doing things the way they have always been. Enforcing new guidelines around the current functionality nine years later is going to be hard, especially since enforcing these guidelines will have to be done by a small group of volunteers, namely the theme and plugin review teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By building WP Notify, we create a new and hopefully better way for plugin and theme developers to connect and communicate with their users. At the same time, we provide a tool by which we can more easily enforce any new guidelines. A guideline could be created for example, that unless your message is strictly within the realms of informing the user about state changes in the system, it needs to be displayed in the notifications center, and not as an admin notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So no, I don&rsquo;t believe WP Notify will be a silver bullet solution. We&rsquo;re not going to build it, ship it, and suddenly all the notification spam goes away the next day. That kind of change takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I do believe it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you agree with me, why not <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-notifications/\">join our merry band and help us build it</a>.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 07 Aug 2020 14:06:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Jonathan Bossenger\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Automattic Relaunches P2, Self-Hosted Version on the Roadmap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102891\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:183:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-relaunches-p2-self-hosted-version-on-the-roadmap?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-relaunches-p2-self-hosted-version-on-the-roadmap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4890:\"<p>Automattic&rsquo;s relaunch of P2 is <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/p2/\">now in Beta</a>. This is the long-awaited update to the company&rsquo;s internal collaboration software that is also used on WordPress.org and other self-hosted sites via a theme. For years, Automattic, which now counts more than 1,200 employees in 77 countries, has had P2 at the core of its written communication tools. It is used as a complement to Slack and video conferencing, providing a public collaboration space for conversations which might otherwise be hidden away in emails. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The older version of P2 functioned as a dependable workhorse with few changes over the years, but the beta introduces some marked improvements that make it more versatile than before. It is now seamlessly integrated with the block editor and includes a streamlined invitation system for onboarding new team members.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>P2 has a fresh design that has come a long way since its roots as an <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2009/05/how-p2-changed-automattic/\">evolution of the Prologue microblogging theme.</a> Many things about WordPress have changed since P2&rsquo;s first launch 11 years ago but threaded conversations have endured as a useful collaboration format. Mobile support is one of the things that has improved significantly. Users can get notifications via the web, email, and the WordPress mobile apps.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It works on the WordPress apps perfectly but it&rsquo;s handled as a normal WordPress site, without any P2 specific functionality,&rdquo; Automattic&rsquo;s P2 launch lead Jon Burke said. &ldquo;P2 specific functionality and improvements are on the mobile app product roadmap. The browser version on the other hand has all the particularities that P2 has.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The beta version of P2 is free and each instance comes with 3GB of storage space for images and files. Users can create as many as they like. The product is built on top of WordPress.com&rsquo;s infrastructure but functions as a scaled back version of a blog &ndash; essentially a WordPress for teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pricing for the commercial upgrade has not yet been determined, according to Burke, but the roadmap includes a hefty list of features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have integrations with third party services, project management features, more storage space, custom URLs, more customization options, etc,&rdquo; Burke said. &ldquo;We plan to introduce multi-site functionality, too, so an organization can create multiple P2s while sharing the same user base, have cross-posting, a common glossary, and other advanced features.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the diverse myriad of blocks pouring into the WordPress ecosystem, every P2 has the opportunity to be unique, depending on which features it introduces through the editor. Burke said Automattic plans to allow admins to extend their P2 instances with plugins in the enterprise version.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>P2 Set to Roll Out on WordPress.com, Self-Hosted Version Coming &ldquo;Eventually&rdquo; </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>P2 is just now entering beta but many fans are already eagerly awaiting a self-hosted version. Burke said it is coming &ldquo;eventually,&rdquo; but the team hasn&rsquo;t yet worked out how it will be structured. The project is not currently available on GitHub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;With this launch version behind us the P2 team will turn to this but don&rsquo;t yet have a time-line,&rdquo; Burke said. &ldquo;The team will need to now define how the backend admin will look.&rdquo; The updated P2 is also coming to power conversations on WordPress.org further down the road.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t yet have a target date but it is on the product roadmap,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This P2 version has been more than a theme or plugin update &ndash; it&rsquo;s really a product concept- so we can&rsquo;t simply update the WordPress.org P2 theme; it requires additional progress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>P2 seems like it would be a good fit for Automattic&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://happy.tools/\">Happy Tools</a> suite of products for distributed teams. A version of P2 with more features may roll out under this brand once the beta concludes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Given the sudden global shift to remote work we really wanted to get out a stable product as soon as we could,&rdquo; Burke said. &ldquo;That really made WordPress.com the most expedient pathway to get P2 into peoples&rsquo; hands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Now that we have launched this version, we will make decisions around where the next releases will live. P2 has been envisioned as being part of the Happy Tools suite. But we are going to learn from the early users on WordPress.com and prioritize the next steps. We know that some users will need a premium version on WordPress.com in order to secure a custom domain and other features so we will update that shortly.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 06 Aug 2020 22:10:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"WPTavern: Plugin Rank Provides Insight Into WordPress Search Results, Competitive Analysis, and Email Reports for Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102835\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:289:\"https://wptavern.com/plugin-rank-provides-insight-into-wordpress-search-results-competitive-analysis-and-email-reports-for-developers?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=plugin-rank-provides-insight-into-wordpress-search-results-competitive-analysis-and-email-reports-for-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6181:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Iain Poulson announced that <a href=\"https://pluginrank.com/\">Plugin Rank</a> is open to the public yesterday. It is a new service that allows plugin authors to track their rankings by keyword on the official WordPress plugin directory. The service is geared toward plugin authors with freemium offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tools were already in place for Poulson to build the service.  He just needed to build his service on top of them.  &ldquo;Plugin Rank leverages the WordPress.org API to retrieve a set of plugins for a search term,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same API that WordPress uses when a user searches for a plugin inside their WordPress dashboard or when searching on the plugin directory.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulson described how a user might search for a membership plugin by typing &ldquo;membership&rdquo; in the search box. The WordPress API returns a set of plugins that best match that term, based on an internal ranking algorithm. The Plugin Rank service uses this same, underlying technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Plugin Rank will check the API daily to find the latest positions of the plugins for the keywords being tracked by Plugin Rank customers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This data is then used to show position movement and charted to show an overall picture of how the plugins are ranking.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Plugin dashboard screen.\n\n\n\n<p>The idea for the service was born from work he and others were doing at <a href=\"https://deliciousbrains.com/\">Delicious Brains</a>, a WordPress development company, a few months ago. &ldquo;We&rsquo;d started to work on improving the copy in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-migrate-db/\">WP Migrate DB</a> plugin readme.txt files to rank higher in search results,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Brad Touesnard set up a Google sheet with all the keywords we wanted to rank for, a link to search the keyword on wordpress.org, and columns for each month. He started to record the position the plugin appears for each keyword every month. Or that was the idea, when we remembered!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poulson began using the same system for <a href=\"https://wpusermanager.com/\">WP User Manager</a> and <a href=\"https://intagrate.io/\">Intagrate</a>, two freemium plugins he had in the plugin directory. However, it did not take long to realize the futility of that system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The sheer manual nature of the task of setting up the sheet, monthly checking, and trying to remember to do it made me think there must be a better way,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So I started to work on an app to do it for me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Besides simply providing a particular plugin&rsquo;s rank, Poulson said the service provides information that can help plugin developers raise their rankings in the search results.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Competitive analysis against other plugins.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The competitor analysis in Plugin Rank gives you an insight into the top 50 plugins that rank for the keywords you care about,&rdquo; said Poulson. &ldquo;It gives you insights into what those plugins are doing that make them rank higher than you. Do they have a high amount of the keyword in their readme? Do they have it in their title or tags? Do they answer the bulk of their support requests? Do they have a large number of five-star ratings?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Premium Service with a Premium Price</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Plugin Rank is the first service of its kind in the WordPress industry. Therefore, Poulson had to look outside of traditional WordPress channels to get a sense of how to <a href=\"https://pluginrank.com/pricing/\">price the new service.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I looked at similar SEO tools for traditional search engines, like <a href=\"https://ahrefs.com/\">Ahrefs</a> and <a href=\"https://www.semrush.com/\">SEMrush</a>, and tried to base my pricing on how valuable it can be in relation to other marketing channels,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only time and feedback will decide whether he found the sweet spot between offering a valuable service and what plugin developers are willing to fork over. The Starter tier allows plugin authors to track up to five keywords for a single plugin. It also includes email reports and competitor analysis. The $9 per month price tag is low enough for developers to dip their toes in and decide whether it is worth upgrading for tracking more keywords and plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The $49 Plus plan allows up to five plugins and 50 keywords. It also includes tracking for multiple languages. The $119 Pro plan bumps the plugin count to 20 and keyword number to 500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, Plugin Rank is offering a 21-day free trial, which is a no-brainer for any freemium plugin author who might even be remotely interested in the service. <em>I have no doubt I would sign up if I was still in the freemium plugin game.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Most developers and companies will invest heavily and get good results from content marketing and SEO improvements, and their WordPress.org plugin listing will receive little attention,&rdquo; said Poulson. &ldquo;But for freemium plugins, it can be a huge channel for getting people using their plugin and buying the up-sells. So it&rsquo;s priced with that in mind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of the Service</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The <em>knowledge</em> of where a plugin stands in the rankings and having the data readily available will undoubtedly help many plugin authors. However, knowledge is merely the beginning of ranking higher.

Up until this point, organizing teams from the large regional camps have been making their own determinations regarding the suitability of hosting an event online. The change announced this week prevents new events from applying and then inevitably having to transition to a virtual format.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing flagship events that were already in the pipeline will be allowed to continue as online events. These include WordCamps Europe, US, Asia, and  Centroam&eacute;rica. Of these, WCEU has already <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-goes-virtual-for-2021-in-person-conference-to-resume-2022\">announced</a> an online event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/building-community-beyond-events/\">online events continue to evolve</a>&nbsp;to reflect community needs, the Community Team strongly encourages these flagship organizing teams to be creative in their approach,&rdquo; Hugh Lashbrooke said in the announcement. This challenge forces organizers to proceed only if they can  knock it out of the park in terms of creativity. Otherwise, it&rsquo;s simply hosting another online conference in the same tired format for the sake of tradition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is at an interesting point in its history where it can no longer rely on in-person events to drive enthusiasm, education, and growth for the community. Flagship WordCamps are a necessary casualty in the fight to slow the spread of the virus, but this early decision provides a welcome peg of certainty for those who normally invest a significant amount of time in making these events a reality.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 21:57:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: Disable Comments Plugin Looking for New Owner, Highest Bid Goes to Charity\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102771\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/disable-comments-plugin-looking-for-new-owner-highest-bid-goes-to-charity?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=disable-comments-plugin-looking-for-new-owner-highest-bid-goes-to-charity\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4743:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Samir Shah is ready to part ways with his popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-comments/\">Disable Comments</a> plugin. The WordPress extension has garnered over a million users and a solid 220 five-star reviews out of 229, but its owner no longer has the time to maintain it. Rather than simply give it away or sell it for profit, he plans to auction it for charity.  The highest bidder will donate to Effective Altruism Funds (EAF), a charitable organization, for ownership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shah asks that those who are interested in bidding on the plugin contact him via his <a href=\"http://twitter.com/solaris_smoke/\">Twitter account</a>. He is also open to feedback on how to approach this at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He first released the Disable Comments plugin in 2011. This was during a time that he was working professionally with WordPress. His primary use case was with corporate clients who did not need any sort of commenting functionality on the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After repeating this implementation on several projects I ported it to a plugin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The plugin became popular very quickly so it turns out this was a common use case.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shah used PHP and WordPress primarily between 2009 and 2015. However, the work his company has been doing has shifted his focus to other languages and platforms. He has not used WordPress professionally since 2016 but has continued maintaining this plugin for the community in his free time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the last year or two I&rsquo;ve found it hard to keep up with the maintenance of the plugin,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m increasingly unfamiliar with both the WordPress core (major changes like Gutenberg, for example) and with newer versions of PHP. It is time to find a new owner who is actively using WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disable Comments allows administrators to disable the comment functionality across the entire site. Users can also control it based on a specific post type or even disable comments across the network when used on a multisite installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary use case is for disabling all commenting-related functionality. When this mode is enabled, the plugin hides comment links from all menus, removes comment widgets, hides the discussion settings screen, disables outgoing pingbacks, and more. Of course, it disables commenting on the front end too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shah also has a <a href=\"https://github.com/solarissmoke/disable-comments-mu\">&ldquo;must use&rdquo; version</a> of the plugin available on GitHub. This comes in handy for professional work where the developer does not want the client to accidentally deactivate the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I never intended to make any money off this plugin, which is completely free to use,&rdquo; said Shah. &ldquo;I have however received a number of financial offers for it over the years (presumably because people value the large user base), and so the idea I had was to auction it. The highest bidder would pay their bid to my preferred charitable organization, and send me a receipt as proof of donation in exchange for ownership of the plugin.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He is hoping that someone in the community will value a free plugin that does not generate revenue. With over a million active installs, there is a possibility that a company could directly or indirectly profit from ownership. Even if not, this would be a good opportunity for someone with the resources to give back to the WordPress community. There is an obvious need for this type of plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Shah says he does not spend much time on charitable work, he does try to donate a percentage of his annual income to charity and believes this is another avenue to do some good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in the privileged position at the moment of having sufficient income to meet my basic needs,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Selling the plugin for profit isn&rsquo;t going to alter my standard of living, and I&rsquo;m not interested in profit for its own sake. If I can extract some value from this plugin and give it to EAF then it will go some way to improving the lives of others.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said he chose EAF because it uses an evidence-based approach to distributing funds by focusing on empirical measures of impact. &ldquo;This felt to me like a better strategy than just picking a cause that I was personally attached to. There are particular areas of their work &mdash; e.g., the long-term future fund &mdash; that I think are especially important today.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will be interesting to see how this type of <em>sale</em> works out. What do you think of trading ownership of a plugin for a charitable contribution?</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 05 Aug 2020 18:45:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.5 Release Candidate 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8764\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/08/wordpress-5-5-release-candidate-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2501:\"<p>The second release candidate for WordPress 5.5 is here!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5 is slated for release&nbsp;on&nbsp;<strong>August 11, 2020</strong>, but we need&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.5 yet,&nbsp;now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test the WordPress 5.5 release candidate in two ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (choose the “bleeding edge nightlies” option)</li><li>Or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.5-RC2.zip\">download the release candidate here (zip)</a>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to all of the contributors who tested the&nbsp;Beta releases and gave feedback.

It was not the first update of the day. The Virginia-based developer is just over a week into what he has called the <em>soft launch</em> of Redux 4.x. It is a major reconstruction of a plugin that has been powering over 900,000 websites and has a strong developer audience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The changes over the past week might seem risky to some. He has built a massive user base by providing one of the most <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/redux-framework/\">powerful theme and plugin options frameworks</a> in WordPress history. The plugin&rsquo;s new focus leans heavily toward the block editor, which is still one of the most controversial features of WordPress, even after nearly two years as part of the core platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paukstys needed to make a change. The developer-only approach was not generating the return on investment that he needed. The $7,000 in donations and subscriptions received in 2019 was not sustainable, especially when products on the Envato marketplace had generated at least $56 million on the back of Redux, according to data he had gathered. He was leaving far too much money on the table. Redux was a successful product on the surface, but developers were either unwilling to pony up the cash or the business plan was not working. It was time for something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was not merely time for a change because the business was essentially going nowhere. The game was and is still changing. Theme options, the bread and butter of Redux, will likely be a thing of the past in the next year or two. Themes will become far less reliant on options panels. Developers will need to build their offerings around the block system and plugins like Redux need to keep up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The writing was on the wall. The best time to profit from a theme options framework was the past decade. Whether it is the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/will-page-builders-remain-competitive-in-the-block-era\">block editor or a page-building plugin</a> like Elementor, design options are on the individual page level now, or at least not buckled into old-school concepts like theme options panels or the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The times they are a-changin&rsquo;</em>, and Redux is changing with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paukstys is no stranger to moving with the flow. It has allowed his framework&rsquo;s user numbers to continue growing over the years. In 2015, he shifted gears and focused on making sure his framework <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/redux-and-kirki-frameworks-join-forces-to-provide-better-support-for-the-wordpress-customizer\">supported the customizer</a>. This came after a controversial decision from the Themes Team to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-now-requires-theme-authors-to-use-the-customizer-to-build-theme-options\">require the use of the customizer</a> instead of custom theme options screens. Paukstys was a vocal opponent of the decision and still believes the customizer never panned out. In hindsight, he may have been right; the customizer has felt like an abandoned project over the past couple of years. Still, he made the necessary moves to keep his options framework relevant when necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, he is propelling Redux into a new era in which blocks reign supreme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If Redux didn&rsquo;t go into the world of blocks it would eventually be a thing of yesterday,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The future is blocks and that&rsquo;s where we are putting our focus. We&rsquo;re excited to once again be on the cutting edge and we hope our product can really help users, freelancers, and agencies build and improve their sites in ways they never have before.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What he and the Redux team has done is tack an entirely new set of user-focused features onto what was once a developer platform. Even the marketing has changed. Redux is now in the business of providing and upselling features to end-users. It is no longer taking a backseat to the theme and plugin authors who have profited in the millions upon its developer API. The team is taking the steering wheel and driving toward its own future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Does the New Redux Do?</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Ice Cream shop template kit.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Redux still does all the things it has always done. Developers can build custom settings screens and offer whatever options they want to their own end-users. The most glaring addition is the new <a href=\"https://templates.redux.io/\">Redux Templates</a> feature, which directly integrates with the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Redux Templates acts as a block discovery library if you will,&rdquo; said Paukstys. &ldquo;We bring all templates provided by third-party plugins into a single library. You can essentially see and preview what&rsquo;s possible, click, and import.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Redux also has a built-in block dependency installer. When importing third-party templates or blocks, it will check if the plugin is installed and active. If not, it will take care of that for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The end goal is to ease the trouble of finding advanced block templates. Currently, most of the block templating plugins are dispersed, projects wondering around the wild. Users cannot find what they need if they do not know where to look. Redux changes all of that. Currently, it supports 18 different block plugins. It serves to give more exposure to existing block plugins and helps users discover solutions they might not have otherwise found.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the post-editing screen, the plugin adds a new &ldquo;Templates&rdquo; button to the top toolbar. Once clicked, it opens a popup with its library of sections, templates, and template kits.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Viewing templates from the Redux library.\n\n\n\n<p>One of the nicer features of the plugin is its previewer. By clicking the preview button, users can see what a section or template looks like before importing anything. On the left side of the previewer, the plugin displays tabs that show what blocks are used and what required plugins would need to be installed and activated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Redux leaves little to the imagination. Any necessary information about what is being installed is directly available. Plus, it provides links to any plugins that might be installed.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Previewing a contact template.\n\n\n\n<p>The great thing is that the Templates feature does not lock the user down to the Redux plugin. If a user wants to deactivate Redux in the future, nothing will change with their blocks. It is primarily serving as a bridge between end-users and the massive world of block projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We see the future of options being diminished in the long run by blocks, so we found a way to move into that space to keep Redux always on the cutting edge,&rdquo; said Paukstys. His team completely rewrote the underlying framework and brought everything up to the WordPress coding standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move to support blocks is more of a repositioning of a project whose days were numbered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paukstys stressed that Redux has every feature that it had before and even more. The team added CSS variables for developers if they prefer using them over a compiler. He feels like the core framework has improved drastically, which means old users can continue enjoying the features they have become accustomed to.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A New Business Plan</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Make no mistake. Paukstys is looking to grow the revenue of his business and create a sustainable future for Redux. The <a href=\"https://redux.io/pricing/\">pricing plan</a> is clear and follows a model that has been successful for many commercial plugins over the years. The plans are tiered and range from $49 per year to $249, depending on the number sites the user wants automatic updates and support for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The commercial plans offer new features for developers like automated Google Font updates, custom fonts integrated into all panels, unlimited widget areas, and dynamic search.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the big upsell is landing directly on the doorstep of end-users. Each of the commercial plans offers full access to over 1,000 sections and full-page templates. The breadth of options can almost be overwhelming, but the average user will be able to find nearly any type of template needed for their site. From restaurants to corporate offices to fitness studios, there is a little something for everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was all too altruistic,&rdquo; said Paukstys of the previous years. &ldquo;I believed that if I helped people make money, they&rsquo;d give back. Unfortunately, that is not how it works. I&rsquo;ve worked for years with various pricing models, each doomed to fail.&rdquo; He had seen others rise to business success, quite often on the work that he had put in. It is not all about money, and he believes he has something of value to offer in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development skill is not enough to breed financial success. Sound financial principles must back it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the catalysts for recent changes to his business plan was joining <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/\">Post Status</a>, which has a strong community of business leaders in the WordPress ecosystem. He credits Alex Denning, Kimberly Lipari, Haris Zulfiqar, Rich Tabor, and others as inspiration, helping him to shift his thinking around the business side of the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the lessons he has learned thus far are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Developers are already starved. Focus on users.</li><li>Add-ons can be a bad model. A single pro/premium product is much easier to sell and manage.</li><li>The need for a revenue model. Don&rsquo;t expect people to just hand over money.</li><li>Use the audience you have. Don&rsquo;t cannibalize yourself.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Where we&rsquo;ve ended up is a <em>much</em> cheaper plan for developers and a powerful toolkit for users,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Hopefully, we&rsquo;re pushing Gutenberg into a greater place of value.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Naturally, not every user will be happy with the overhaul of the plugin. For years, Redux was geared specifically toward developers. It was an options framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Redux was for a completely different purpose which is for developers to create Options framework,&rdquo; wrote a user named James <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/dishonest-and-bad-performance/\">in a review</a>. &ldquo;They have changed the plugin suddenly to a page builder something like that. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense and they are using the previous plugin&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is a fair criticism. And, it was expected. The plugin has switched much of its focus to end-users. However, it has not removed the existing API and features that made it successful with developers in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Paukstys is clear that he is building on top of the reputation that Redux has earned and launching new features for end-users. He is unapologetic about trying something new to bring in a reasonable return on his years-long investment of time and resources. Launching a completely new and separate project would carry far more risk. It makes sense to build atop the mountain he had already built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It won&rsquo;t make everyone happy. However, he said that the feedback has been &ldquo;shockingly positive&rdquo; in the week since the Redux 4 soft launch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never realized how much users appreciated Redux,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Some of the changes to the framework broke sites, and everyone I have reached out to help has been so extremely gracious. It&rsquo;s so refreshing and honestly helps me to see why the WordPress community is such a great place to be. I fear developers are too harsh to one another. Users on the other hand, if provided kind support, are in turn incredibly kind.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If most of the feedback thus far is any indication of the plugin&rsquo;s future, do not expect to see pitchforks and torches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He might have to take a few lumps with a few disgruntled users over the change. It comes with the territory. However, feedback will likely directly correlate with how well he serves users through the Redux support channels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project will also benefit from a potentially new user base in the coming months and years. The plugin is dipping its toes into a new market while maintaining the features that got it to where it is today. It will be a bit of a balancing act, but the plugin must move with the times.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Future of Redux</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This is a new era for Redux. In the immediate future, Paukstys and team will need to focus on ironing out all of the bugs and the transition to a new market. It is a time for reflection, careful listening, and attentiveness before diving headlong into new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the past, we were 100% developer-centric,&rdquo; said Paukstys. &ldquo;That being said, we always had our eye on the user and wanted to fulfill their needs. Now we&rsquo;re expanding to support the users directly, as well as developers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the newfound focus on end-users, there is potential for growth in other areas. Paukstys says the focus is 100% on the block editor at present. Branching out to support other major page builders like Elementor is not out of the question. However, Redux should be able to continue finding success by extending the core experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When we started this adventure into the blocks space, we worried, given the limited number of blocks out there,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But honestly, there&rsquo;s some amazing innovation out there, and it&rsquo;s been pretty great what we can build with Gutenberg.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 04 Aug 2020 14:21:45 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:102:\"WPTavern: Automattic Updates Press Page to Clarify Distinction between WordPress.org and WordPress.com\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102612\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:249:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-updates-press-page-to-clarify-distinction-between-wordpress-org-and-wordpress-com?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-updates-press-page-to-clarify-distinction-between-wordpress-org-and-wordpress-com\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6031:\"<p>Last week, Automattic&rsquo;s marketing team made a positive step towards curbing the perennial branding confusion between WordPress.org and WordPress.com. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://automattic.com/press/\">press page</a> was updated with a notice to journalists who are writing about Automattic:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Automattic owns and operates&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>, which is a hosted version of the open source WordPress software with added features for security, speed and support.

Automattic is a major contributor to the WordPress open source project. If you would like to contribute to the WordPress open source project, learn more at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">make.wordpress.org</a>.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>This update was prompted by a recent <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/caspar-hubinger_wordpress-activity-6688334765575176192-0-Eh\">conversation on LinkedIn</a> between Caspar H&uuml;binger, who works as a digital marketer at Human Made, and WordPress.com CMO Monica Ohara. H&uuml;binger had posted regarding an inaccuracy in a recent New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/business/matt-mullenweg-automattic-corner-office.html\">article</a> featuring Matt Mullenweg as an evangelist for remote work at Automattic. The article, which has since been corrected, misattributed Automattic as the company that &ldquo;runs the digital publishing platform WordPress.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These kinds of mistakes are quite frequent, yet understandable, in publications that are not as familiar with the WordPress ecosystem. Yet, these errors often evoke a strong reaction from the project&rsquo;s community whenever they pop up in the media. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ohara commented on H&uuml;binger&rsquo;s post and exchanged direct messages where he made a case for clarifying the branding on Automattic&rsquo;s website. Ohara was amenable and the notice appeared shortly after the exchange.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several years ago H&uuml;binger created a <a href=\"https://wpisnotwp.com/\">website</a> to clarify the confusion between WordPress, the open source project, and WordPress.com. Post Status also has a <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/resources/wordpress-versus-automattic/\">resource page</a> that explains the difference between WordPress.org and Automattic&rsquo;s products, but these kinds of external resources never seemed to make much of a difference. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, H&uuml;binger prevailed upon the author of a TechCrunch article who referenced&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://wordpress.com/\">WordPress.com</a>&nbsp;as &ldquo;WordPress&rdquo; and worked with her on getting the difference documented in TechCrunch&rsquo;s internal editorial guidelines. After he had explained the problem, she replied: &ldquo;We had no policy on this. We&rsquo;re going to change it to .com (or make references to Automattic as needed), and note in our style guide.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked why he finds himself a champion of this particular cause, he said he often found himself angry when the name of the open source project he has dedicated most of his digital career to was confused with a commercial service built on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a distortion of reality and I always felt sort of betrayed when it happened,&rdquo; H&uuml;binger said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I know that many of my community peers feel hurt to this day, even if some of them would probably shrug it off when asked. The word for it is resignation, and to me, it is poison to the human soul. From my perspective, Automattic&rsquo;s passiveness actively fed the narrative that they were profiting from the naming confusion, and that narrative &ndash; true or not &ndash; it keeps poisoning WordPress&rsquo; open source community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although many times articles with errors confusing WordPress and .com were corrected afterwards, it can take a few days after the initial rush of traffic hits. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So the message that &lsquo;Automattic runs/owns WordPress&rsquo; keeps being established for the public,&rdquo; H&uuml;binger contended when making his case to Ohara. &ldquo;Worse, the burden of flagging miscommunication when it happens and having it corrected in many cases is left to those who are harmed by it, i.e. open source contributors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For years people have speculated whether Automattic might rename WordPress.com to avoid the longstanding confusion. Many believe it will never happen, since the company undoubtedly benefits from tightly coupling its products to WordPress&rsquo; name recognition. Ohara declined to comment on whether any major branding changes are on the horizon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I will say that we&rsquo;re not trying to compete with the WordPress ecosystem,&rdquo; Ohara said. &ldquo;We want to help the overall ecosystem grow and I look forward to working closely with the community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This small yet important change to Automattic&rsquo;s press page is the direct result of H&uuml;binger&rsquo;s persistent advocacy effort. It may not eliminate all future media errors, but it is a positive development that demonstrates someone is listening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While a dedicated press page will not be able to prevent future confusion of WordPress and WordPress.com altogether (because it simply isn&rsquo;t possible), my hope is that it will be seen as a first practical step to help heal the relationship between Automattic and parts of WordPress&rsquo; open source community, which so many Automatticians have made such incredible amounts of contributions to ever since the company existed, and that is another thing that is too easy to forget,&rdquo; H&uuml;binger said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Aug 2020 17:35:09 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: July 2020\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=8755\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/08/the-month-in-wordpress-july-2020/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11541:\"<p>July was an action-packed month for the WordPress project.

Read on to catch up with all the updates from the WordPress world.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress 5.5 Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>July was full of WordPress 5.5 updates! The WordPress 5.5 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-1\">Beta 1</a> came out on July 7, followed by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-2/\">Beta 2</a> on July 14, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-3/\">Beta 3</a> on July 21, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-beta-4/\">Beta 4</a> on July 27. Subsequently, the team also published the first <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/07/wordpress-5-5-release-candidate/\">release candidate</a> of WordPress 5.5 on July 28.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.5, which is slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-5/\">August 11, 2020</a>, is a major update with features like <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-autoupdates/\">automatic updates for plugins and themes</a>, a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2020/07/22/proposed-block-directory-guidelines/\">block directory</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/10/merge-announcement-extensible-core-sitemaps/\">XML sitemaps</a>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/16/block-patterns-in-wordpress-5-5/\">block patterns</a>, and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/14/lazy-loading-images-in-5-5/\">lazy-loading images</a>, among others.

The team has also started working on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/13/reimagining-online-events/\">reimagining online events</a>. Based on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/13/reimagining-online-events/#comment-28505\">feedback from the community members</a>, the team decided to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/moving-forward-with-online-events/\">make changes to the current online WordCamp format</a>. Key changes include wrapping up financial support for A/V vendors, ending event swag support for newer online WordCamps, and suspending the Global Community Sponsorship program for 2020. The team encourages upcoming online WordCamps to experiment with their events to facilitate an effective learning experience for attendees while avoiding online event fatigue. The team is currently working on a proposal to organize community-supported <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/building-community-beyond-events/\">recorded workshops and synchronous discussion groups</a> to help community members learn WordPress.<br /><br />Want to get involved with the Community team? <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/\">Follow the Community blog here</a>, or join them in the #community-events channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>. To organize a Meetup or WordCamp, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/virtual-events/welcome/applying-for-a-virtual-event/\">visit the handbook page</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordCamp US 2020 is canceled</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizers of WordCamp US 2020 have <a href=\"https://2020.us.wordcamp.org/2020/07/30/wcus-2020-an-update/\">canceled the event</a> in light of the continued pandemic and online event fatigue. The flagship event, which was originally scheduled for October 27-29 as an in-person event, had already planned to transition to an online event. Several WCUS Organizers will be working with the WordPress Community team to focus on other formats and ideas for online events, including a 24-hour contributor day, and contributing to the workshops initiative <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/23/building-community-beyond-events/\">currently being discussed</a>. Matt Mullenweg’s State of the Word (which typically accompanies WordCamp US) is likely to take place in a different format later in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugin and theme updates are now available over zip files</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After eleven years, WordPress now allows users to update plugins and themes by <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/48390\">uploading a ZIP file, in WordPress 5.5</a>.&nbsp; The feature, which was merged on July 7, has been one of the most requested features in WordPress. Now, when a user tries to upload a plugin or theme zip file from the WordPress dashboard by clicking the “Install Now” button, WordPress will direct users to a new screen that compares the currently-installed extension with the uploaded versions. Users can then choose between continuing with the installation or canceling. WordPress 5.5 will also offer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-autoupdates/\">automatic plugin and theme updates</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2020/07/22/proposed-block-directory-guidelines/\">Block directory</a> is coming to WordPress with the 5.5 release.

The team is considering an in-person WordCamp EU in 2022. </li><li>The Polyglots team has prepared and finalized a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2020/07/09/translation-editor-locale-manager-vetting-criteria-page-draft/\">Translation Editor &amp; Locale Manager Vetting Criteria</a> to provide more clarity on how global mentors assign PTE/GTE/Locale Managers and to help locale teams set their own guidelines. The document, which was finalized <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/2020/07/09/translation-editor-locale-manager-vetting-criteria-page-draft/\">after a lot of discussion</a>, is now available in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/expectations/translation-editor-locale-manager-vetting-criteria/\">Polyglots handbook</a>.</li><li>Members of the Community team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2020/07/03/proposal-recognition-for-event-volunteers-and-attendees-in-wordpress-org-profile/\">are discussing</a> whether WordCamp volunteers, WordCamp attendees, or Meetup attendees should be awarded a WordPress.org profile badge. The ongoing discussion will be open for comments until August 13.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/feature-notifications/\">WP Notify project</a>, which aims to create a better way to manage and deliver notifications to the relevant audience, is on to its next steps. The team has finalized the initial requirements, and is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/09/wp-notify-next-steps/\">kicking off the project build</a>.</li><li>The WordPress documentation team is <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/external-linking-policy/\" target=\"_blank\">considering a ban on links to commercial websites</a> in a revision to its external linking policy. The policy change does not remove external links to commercial sites from WordPress.org and only applies to documentation sites. The idea is to protect documentation from being abused, and to prevent the WordPress project from being biased. Discussion on this post is still ongoing, and a decision has not yet been made. Feel free to<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/tag/external-linking-policy/\"> comment on the discussion posts</a>, if you would like to share your thoughts on the topic. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

The charity organization focuses on supporting remote working communities with education and resources for mental and physical health. It is also home to a community of more than 4,700 members who support each other in growing their businesses and building new skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey asks fairly broad questions about your mental health and the mental health support in your work environment. It takes approximately three minutes and is completely anonymous.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Results from the 2019 survey showed that the majority of people in the WordPress community work alone and a significant percentage are dealing with anxiety and suicidal thoughts:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>8% of the WordPress community have had suicidal thoughts in the last 12 months</li><li>47% stated their workplace makes them feel anxious</li><li>56% of the WordPress community works alone</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Big Orange Heart founder Dan Maby believes these results are helping his team save lives. The charity is actively creating and maintaining services and a peer support network that encourage people to stay connected to their community, in order to reduce the isolation they experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our 2019 results identified that almost 8% of all respondents had been dealing with sustained periods of feeling suicidal over the previous 12-months, twice the national US average,&rdquo; Maby said.&nbsp;&ldquo;This finding led to more training being provided in suicide prevention and support for our team, which enabled us to support multiple individuals that have contacted us requiring suicidal support, all of whom are still with us today.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more people working alone remotely now than ever before due to the pandemic. Spend a short time on any social media network and you will likely hear several people say they are not doing okay. This survey helps the team at Big Orange Heart understand the extent of mental health related issues within the remote working community and informs various initiatives the organization plans throughout the year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As a charity, like so many others at this time, we have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 global crisis,&rdquo; Maby said. &ldquo;Now more than ever we need to ensure our limited resources are used in the most effective way possible. Your anonymous data will allow us to best understand how we can help improve the lives of others within our community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.bigorangeheart.org/survey-2020.html\">Remote Work Wellbeing and Mental Health Survey</a> runs for one month and will close on August 31st. Take the survey and check out Big Orange Heart&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.bigorangeheart.org/blog/\">blog</a> for several helpful posts on how to maintain your mental health while working during this crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 01 Aug 2020 03:04:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.6 Wish List: Homepage Post Type Selection and Block Management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102615\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-6-wish-list-homepage-post-type-selection-and-block-management?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-6-wish-list-homepage-post-type-selection-and-block-management\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4584:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">With the WordPress 5.5 development cycle coming to a close, it is time to begin mapping out what features should land in WordPress 5.6 later this year. Earlier today, Chloe Bringmann <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/31/wordpress-5-6-whats-on-your-wishlist/\">asked the community to chime in</a> with its wish list on the Make Core blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As usual, I have a few thoughts. I tend to lean toward addressing some of the long-standing developer-friendly tickets because these features allow plugin authors to build better products for end-users in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A complete <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-call-for-wordpress-5-5-tickets-whats-on-your-wish-list\">custom post status API</a> tops my usual list of most-wanted features. I have already opined over this for my WordPress 5.5 wish list. It may be time for more realistic dreams. Maybe we will revisit it another year or two down the road. However, if any core leads want to give the feature a green light, I will gladly be the evangelist and get others excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Homepage Post Type Selection</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For this release, I want to call out one of my other years-long wishes. WordPress should allow end-users to select any custom post type for display on the homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a WordPress where users can head to their Reading Settings screen in the admin and select something other than their normal posts list or a page to appear on the homepage. <em>Have a forum plugin installed?</em> Maybe users want to list their latest topics or forums list. <em>Running an eCommerce plugin?</em> Users should be able to display their products. <em>Setting up a web design portfolio?</em> Display the most recent projects by simply selecting this choice in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an area where the software has always catered to bloggers and has avoided throwing a little love to other types of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, plugin authors must perform some crazy hacks to make this work. The WooCommerce <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/blob/master/includes/class-wc-query.php\">custom query class</a> is enough to make any developer give up. Not all of the code in that file is for the front page, but it has a frustrating amount to make something work that should be far simpler for plugin authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason this needs to be in core WordPress is so that each and every plugin does not need to roll a custom solution. Plugins should be able to flag their post types during registration as &ldquo;allowed on homepage&rdquo; &mdash; not all post types are meant for this type of display. Then, WordPress should handle all the dirty work behind the scenes if a particular post type is selected by the end-user. The addition to the API for plugin authors would be simple, and plugins that are already hacking this feature together can drop a lot of unnecessary code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an existing <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/19958\">8-year-old ticket</a> for the feature. It has a few old and likely outdated patches and has not seen any real activity in the past four years. Nevertheless, it would be nice to see this feature in core WordPress and finally close the ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block System Wish List</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Like most releases, the block system will be getting the most attention. The things that will land in WordPress 5.6 are mostly already set in stone, assuming a particular feature does not fall behind in development like widgets and nav menus did for the 5.5 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, I like the general direction the block system has been headed. If anything, I have been impatient with some things, such as awaiting the integrated <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/version-1-prototype-of-the-wordpress-admin-block-directory-announced\">block management screen</a> in the admin. For other features, such as full-site editing, I am still wondering whether they are realistic goals for the WordPress 5.6 release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would take a release and focus on tightening up and polishing the existing system. Take stock of the pain points &mdash; and there are many &mdash; that users are mentioning.

In April, organizers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2020-goes-online-cancels-in-person-event\">transitioned to planning for it to be held as a virtual event</a>, but the tenuous situation with the pandemic in the United States and the stress on the event&rsquo;s large crew of volunteers has precipitated a full cancellation. The decision was announced on the WCUS website:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>It is with heavy hearts that we have made the decision to cancel this year&rsquo;s WordCamp US event. In light of the continued pandemic, online event fatigue for attendees, organizers, and volunteers, and the desire for WordCamp experiences to be&nbsp;<em>traditional</em>&nbsp;WordCamp experiences, we have made the difficult decision to stop this year&rsquo;s planning, and cancel WordCamp US 2020.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>After the pandemic started forcing WordCamps and meetups to go online, many community team members seemed to put on a brave face about adapting WordCamps to virtual events, but WCUS organizers are publicly recognizing the reality of online event fatigue. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Angela Jin, one of the lead organizers, said her team discussed how recent online WordCamps have struggled to meet traditional goals of connecting people and encouraging contribution. In light of attendees&rsquo; increasing online conference fatigue, WCUS organizers considered the cost of volunteers&rsquo; time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Lead Organizers also took into consideration how many volunteers we have on this team, and how much time we were asking them to invest in an event that didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to offer the same level of joy or satisfaction that an in-person WordCamp would,<strong>&ldquo;</strong> Jin said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As you might imagine, this was a very upsetting realization, but the whole team spent time discussing together, and we believe that we made the right decision.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. passed more than 150,000 Coronavirus deaths this week and outbreaks are worsening right as schools are supposed to be opening. As COVID-19 cases continue to rise sharply in many states, renewed lockdowns and political tensions have put people on edge. Every day brings a fresh injection of bad news and the country is deeply mired in division ahead of one of the most contentious presidential elections in history. Late October is not an ideal time to try to host WordPress&rsquo; flagship WordCamp online. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One WCUS organizer, who requested to remain anonymous, said he was angry that he invested more than 100 hours across various organizing teams and wished it had come sooner. He described how multiple personal stressors were impacting daily life and draining the team&rsquo;s energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I feel everyone is tired and worn out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;They are stressed &ndash; we are all losing friends [to COVID-19]. Everyone is fighting about politics and the work suffered.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He reported that many organizers were not doing their parts and all tasks were delayed. Although he experienced a high level of frustration with how it was handled, he was relieved when the decision was announced. Many of the event&rsquo;s 50 organizers are also involved in coordinating local meetups and leading other WordCamps, and their energies are spread thin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This will pave the way for something new and better,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have to evolve as a community and one more zoom meeting is not it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all organizers considered the time invested as a loss. Cate DeRosia, who has also helped organize WordCamp Grand Rapids in the past, said the lead WCUS organizers consulted with the entire team through a multi-step process and gave opportunities for their opinions to be heard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s easy to imagine that as an organizer I&rsquo;d be disappointed by this decision, but that couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth,&rdquo; Cate DeRosia said. &ldquo;None of this is what I&rsquo;d hoped for, but the time I&rsquo;ve invested in WCUS has helped me grow relationships and learn new skills that ultimately help me further my career goals and make me a better volunteer in the future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;COVID-19 has been unpredictable and made everything about life harder. By making this difficult decision now, we all get back a little of our time to invest in other areas instead of using up more energy and risking volunteer burnout for an event that ran the risk of getting lost amid other online events.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>State of the Word May be Hosted as a Separate, Focused Event</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WCUS is encouraging speakers to apply again next year. Although all regular sessions on the program were canceled, some organizers will be shifting their focus to hosting a 24-hour contributor day along with producing some workshops and youth programming content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s annual State of the Word address is also expected to happen but will likely take a different format this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Discussions about the State of the Word are still active; our understanding is that it will still happen, but possibly not in association with any other event,&rdquo; Jin said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really excited about the potential for lots of smaller, focused, and educational ways for the community to connect online this year,&rdquo; Matt Mullenweg said. &ldquo;For the State of the Word I don&rsquo;t have a plan yet, I think there&rsquo;s less value to us watching the same thing at the same time if we can&rsquo;t hang out afterward, but it still would be fun to celebrate the great progress we&rsquo;ve been making with some sort of video. Stay tuned November-ish.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cancellation costs for WCUS are still being finalized. Prior to making it a virtual event, the original budget was close to $1 million, with the largest costs being the venue and catering. Jin said the team will publish a full accounting of expenses on the Community Team blog or the event site after the last round of discussions with vendors are complete.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s too soon to know if the WordCamp will be an in-person event in 2021. When asked if they will be hosting in St. Louis again, Jin said that any decisions regarding WCUS 2021 are paused for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The WCUS team did invest a lot of time and energy into this event, but in a year when it is incredibly hard to plan anything, we did the best we could and adapted quickly,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sad, of course, as I miss seeing everyone at WordCamps, but even if it was time and energy invested in something that didn&rsquo;t happen, I spent time doing it with brilliant people who care just as much about WordPress as I do. It&rsquo;s been an immensely challenging year, and I&rsquo;m humbled to have been a part of this team, which has consistently supported each other and grown together in the face of adversity.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 01:04:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Post a Lot of Code?

Far too many plugins use shortcodes, custom blocks, or other odd solutions. However, there is one option that I intentionally overlooked when it was released over a year ago: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-syntax-block/\">Code Syntax Block</a> by Marcus Kazmierczak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on the name, I assumed it was yet another standalone block. However, I have since given it another look and realized that this was note the case. It integrates directly with the core WordPress block. There are times when a new block is necessary, but this is not one of those times. Sometimes it is better to extend the existing blocks in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Code Syntax Block uses the <a href=\"https://prismjs.com/\">Prism JavaScript library</a> to add syntax highlighting on the front end of the site. The plugin is designed well. It loads its scripts and styles only when the code block is in use.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Front end PHP code example.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin does not load Prism in the editor, so the code output will use the default editor or theme styling. This may not appeal to those who want a one-to-one match between the back and front end.  I am comfortable with  the non-highlighted version in the admin while having the <em>pretty</em> output on the front end.  However, it would be nice to see an option or filter to enable highlighting in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Out of the box, the plugin uses the <a href=\"https://github.com/AGMStudio/prism-theme-one-dark\">One Dark</a> theme, which was created for the Atom editor and ported to Prism. Developers can overwrite the theme with either a custom <code>assets/prism/prism.css</code> file in their theme or by filtering the path or URL that gets loaded.  The Prism project has a <a href=\"https://github.com/PrismJS/prism-themes\">variety of themes</a> available that are plug-and-play.  Other themes exist outside of the official list too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the admin side, the plugin creates a new &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; tab for the code block and adds a few options that users can choose from:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Language</li><li>Show line numbers</li><li>Title for code block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Editor view of Code Syntax Highlighter\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the plugin does not support the full list of over 200 languages. Instead, it lists just over 40 of the most popular. The list is filterable, so anyone can add or remove languages with a few lines of code. There is also a filter hook for setting the default languages, which would be particularly useful for those who routinely post code snippets in the same coding language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a few days of testing, I can safely say that Code Syntax Block is being added to my WordPress toolbox. I wish I had only given it a shot much sooner.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 17:30:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WPTavern: Bing Launches URL Submissions Plugin for WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102450\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:165:\"https://wptavern.com/bing-launches-url-submissions-plugin-for-wordpress?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=bing-launches-url-submissions-plugin-for-wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5150:\"<p>Bing has <a href=\"https://blogs.bing.com/webmaster/july-2020/Get-your-WordPress-content-indexed-immediately-using-Bing-Webmaster-Tools-plugin\">launched</a> its first official <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bing-webmaster-tools/\">plugin</a> for WordPress aimed at helping site owners get their content indexed immediately. Instead of waiting for a bingbot to crawl the site, the plugin notifies Bing of any new or updated content automatically using its <a href=\"https://www.bing.com/webmasters/url-submission-api\">Submit URL API</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Bing&nbsp;believes that the future for search engines is less about crawling to discover content and more about sharing new and updated content across the web, a fundamental shift in the way that search engines handle web sites,&rdquo; Bing Product Manager Fabrice Canel said. &ldquo;Instead of monitoring RSS, sitemaps and HTML pages to check for new pages, discover content changes and/or new outbound links, websites will notify search engines directly about relevant URLs changing on their website.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Search engines can take anywhere from several hours to a few weeks to <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6065812?hl=en\">crawl a website</a>. Bing&rsquo;s API allows site owners to get content indexed immediately, while eventually reducing the crawling frequency for sites where there are no changes. Users will need to <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingwebmaster/getting-access#using-api-key\">generate an API key</a> in order to configure the plugin for access to the Bing Webmaster Tools API.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p><br />The new plugin also introduces a few other options for managing URL submissions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Toggle the automatic submission feature</li><li>Manually submit a URL to Bing Index</li><li>View list of recent URL submissions from the plugin</li><li>Retry any failed submissions from the recent submissions list</li><li>Download recent URL submissions for analysis</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Canel said the Bing Webmaster Team recommends using the new URL Submissions plugin as a complement to existing plugins that connect sites to Bing, such as <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/site-verification-tools/\">Jetpack&rsquo;s site verification tool</a>, and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/SEO/\">SEO plugins</a> that add XML sitemaps. Bing&rsquo;s plugin is different in that it focuses on enabling Bing to discover immediate changes on WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Sitemaps are a great complementary solution to our plugin to discover all URLs on WordPress sites, but we cannot monitor each sitemap all the time,&rdquo; Canel said. &ldquo;Only a small percentage of WordPress sites are publishing content every day. Most are nearly static and this is preferable to be notified instead of pulling content every so often for them. Same for sites publishing often, it helps to get the content quickly indexed instead of having to wait a long time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bing doesn&rsquo;t usually get as much airtime as Google and its supporting tools, since Google continues to dominate the search market. Bing&rsquo;s market share is currently <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share/\">hovering at 2.75%</a> of searches globally on all platforms as of June 2020. </p>\n\n\n\n<div id=\"all-search_engine-ww-monthly-201906-202006\" width=\"600\" height=\"400\"></div><!-- You may change the values of width and height above to resize the chart --><p>Source: <a href=\"https://gs.statcounter.com/search-engine-market-share\">StatCounter Global Stats &ndash; Search Engine Market Share</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The search engine has seen slow but steady growth in certain regions and platforms. Bing performs higher globally across desktop searches (6.08%).

For developers who have not been completely on top of the upcoming release, now is a good time to start looking at how changes might affect their projects. Theme authors in particular can expect several new features and some breaking changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, WordPress 5.5 will introduce new features that theme developers can begin to add to their themes. However, the two biggest changes that could negatively impact their themes will be automatic updates and direct HTML changes to the custom logo output.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of the new features and changes, theme authors should catch up on our <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/tag/gutenberg\">coverage of the Gutenberg plugin</a> and test against its updates that are being merged into core WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Auto Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress 5.5 will finally introduce <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automatic-theme-and-plugin-updates-slated-for-wordpress-5-5\">automatic updates for plugins and themes.</a> It is a long-awaited feature and should be a good thing in terms of keeping end-users updated and running what is usually the most secure version of their extensions. However, the big downside to automatic updates is that most themes and plugins will not have the same level of quality control as core WordPress receives. Even the best development companies might have only a few people looking over the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the flip-side, the automatic updates feature means that theme authors can push fixes out to end-users much more quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big thing is that theme developers need to be aware that users will be enabling automatic updates. For some, this might not mean changing anything with their release cycles. For others, it might mean tacking on some extra time to ensure that extra quality control is in place. The success of automatic updates lies directly on the shoulders of the plugin and theme authors. It is a huge responsibility that should not be taken lightly. WordPress is placing a lot of trust in its development community to get this right.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>HTML Change for Custom Logos</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As part of an <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37011\">accessibility-related ticket</a> for WordPress 5.5, the core <code>get_custom_logo()</code> and <code>the_custom_logo()</code> functions will no longer <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/28/themes-changes-related-to-get_custom_logo-in-wordpress-5-5/\">output a link around the logo image</a> when viewing the site homepage. This change was made because the link itself points to the homepage by default and is unnecessary in that context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, there are 183 themes in the official theme directory that target the link in their CSS. This does not necessarily mean that all 183 themes will be broken upon update. However, it likely means that some of them will need a tweak or two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors are encouraged to target the <code>.custom-logo-link</code> class instead of any particular HTML element. The new change will add a <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> element rather than an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element on the homepage. Both will use the same class.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Patterns Have Arrived</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It is no secret that I am <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-patterns-will-change-everything\">downright giddy</a> about the prospect of theme designers being loosed upon the world, allowing their talents to shine via block patterns.  Patterns have been one of the missing features since the initial launch of the Gutenberg project. For theme authors, they represent that missing link between designing unique &ldquo;templates&rdquo; or &ldquo;sections&rdquo; and providing end-users a means to add them to their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block patterns are essentially groups of pre-configured blocks that users can insert into their posts or pages at the click of a button. The beauty of the system is that theme authors can design whatever patterns their hearts desire and make them easily available to their users. No need for complicated theme settings. No lengthy tutorials explaining how to recreate the demo. Design something in the block editor. Register it as a pattern. Let users insert it into a post and rejoice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an opportunity that theme authors have never had before. It is an opportunity to create beautiful designs without having to worry about overcomplicating it for the average user. It is a pivotal moment in WordPress theme design history. Theme authors have the chance to push the system and see what WordPress and its block editor are truly capable of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Building a restaurant theme?</em> Provide users with multiple food menu patterns. <em>Creating something for novelists or other book authors?</em> Give users some layout options for showcasing their books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/developers/block-api/block-patterns/\">block patterns API</a> removes many prior limits to what theme authors could realistically do. Now, it&rsquo;s time for those theme authors to take charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Line Heights and Custom Units</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The block editor has two new tools for end-users to take advantage of: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/27/new-block-tools-on-wordpress-5-5/\">custom line-heights and custom units</a>. Theme authors can opt into allowing users to edit the line-height of paragraphs and headings with the <code>custom-line-heights</code> theme support flag. They can also allow users to switch between various units, such as when defining the Cover block&rsquo;s height, with the <code>custom-units</code> flag. In addition to pixels, themes can define which units are supported.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Allowing users to customize the line-height value for text can be tricky business. There are some situations where it is warranted. However, for theme authors who prefer to maintain a strict vertical rhythm, this could lead to disaster. This will likely come down to a personal choice for developers based on what type of theme they are building.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessible Widgets Navigation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Starting with WordPress 5.5, theme authors will be able to opt into outputting more <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/09/accessibility-improvements-to-widgets-outputting-lists-of-links-in-5-5/\">accessible widgets</a>. By default, widgets that display unordered lists do so without any context. This can make it difficult for those using assistive technologies to navigate the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can now add <code>navigation-widgets</code> to the HTML5 theme supports array to add the new markup. WordPress will then wrap all core widgets with a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element and an <code>aria-label</code> based on the widget title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This will not affect widgets from third-party plugins. Plugin authors should reevaluate their widgets to determine if they want to support this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Template Functions Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress is tacking on some nice features for its templating functions in the upcoming release. The first major change is that theme authors can pass data to template files. We have <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/theme-authors-can-pass-data-to-template-files-in-wordpress-5-5\">previously covered</a> this story on the Tavern. This feature, while years late, should still be useful for more complex theming setups and allow developers to bypass odd workarounds or in-house solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template-loading functions, such as <code>get_template_part()</code> and others, will also <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40969\">return a value</a> in WordPress 5.5. If the template is not found, the function will return a <code>false</code> value. Otherwise, it will return <code>void</code>. This will be helpful in situations where theme authors need to run a conditional to check if a template exists.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 22:05:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 8.6 Adds Cover Block Video Positioning and Updates Block Patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=102512\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:215:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-8-6-adds-cover-block-video-positioning-and-updates-block-patterns?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-8-6-adds-cover-block-video-positioning-and-updates-block-patterns\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4671:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 8.6 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/07/22/whats-new-in-gutenberg-july-22/\">landed quietly last week</a>. Much of the focus right now is ironing out the remaining bugs for WordPress 5.5 during its beta cycle. However, that does not mean the Gutenberg project has come to a complete halt in terms of new features. The team is marching forward with extra goodies for those who use the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest update of the plugin did not cover as much ground as normal, but it does include an enhancement for the Cover block when using a video background and several updates to block patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary focus for version 8.6 was squashing bugs. The development team addressed over three dozen of them while correcting a handful of performance issues. While new features and enhancements from 8.6 onward are not expected in the upcoming WordPress 5.5, most bug fixes should be included.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Focal Point Selector for Video Covers</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a focal point for a video background.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Cover block has long allowed users to pick a focal point for background images. However, this feature was missing when users added a background video to the block. As of version 8.6, that is no longer the case. Both image and video backgrounds should work in much the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg now has a new &ldquo;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22531\">Focal point picker</a>&rdquo; option located under the &ldquo;Media settings&rdquo; tab when adding a video background. Users can select the focal point by dragging the circle icon in the video box or hardcode left and top percentage values in the input fields below it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a particularly exciting development for most Gutenberg users.  Self-hosting video is not cheap and remains unused for most. However, for those who do use video backgrounds, it is one of those nice-to-have features that is there when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Updated Block Patterns</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Inserting the updated quote block pattern.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Gutenberg team updated several of the existing block patterns. For the most part, the pattern updates were minor cosmetic changes, tweaks that improve the overall design. The button-related patterns received simple changes, such as new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/23848\">text labels</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/23849\">colors</a>. The developers also changed the colors and text of the large header patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team moved the header above the columns in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/23853\">two columns text pattern</a> and changed the text to make the columns appear equal height by default. It is a poor use of textual columns, which would ideally be handled with CSS instead so that it works appropriately across screen sizes. Perhaps it would be better to have a &ldquo;Text Columns&rdquo; block in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nicest block pattern update was for the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/23881\">quote pattern</a>. It now has an image at the top and a separator at the bottom. It is akin to a single testimonial, which is more of a <em>pattern</em> than a basic quote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can also <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/24042\">remove support</a> for the core block patterns with a single line of code: <code>remove_theme_support( \'core-block-patterns\' )</code>. This does not drop support for patterns altogether. For example, patterns added by plugins or the theme will still appear in the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Icon Used in Fullscreen Mode</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Site icon appears in top left in fullscreen mode.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When writing in fullscreen mode, the &ldquo;back to posts&rdquo; link has utilized the WordPress logo in the past. In version 8.6, the user&rsquo;s custom <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/22952\">site icon will take its place</a>. However, this will only happen if the user has uploaded an icon via the customizer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am unsure how I feel about this change. In practice, it almost feels like clicking the icon should take me to the front end of the site instead of the post management screen. At least with the WordPress icon, it felt like it was pointing toward an admin-side screen instead. For my workflow, I would rather see this link/icon replaced with a button that toggles between fullscreen and normal mode, popping the admin menu back into place rather than departing the editing screen altogether.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 28 Jul 2020
