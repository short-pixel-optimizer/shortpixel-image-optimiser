# Shared shell helper: retry a command with exponential backoff.
#
# Sourced by bin/test-e2e.sh. Kept in its own file so it can be tested in
# isolation (see the self-test at the bottom, `bash bin/lib/retry.sh --self-test`).
#
# Why: registry pulls from GitHub Actions runners occasionally die with
# "connection reset by peer" while fetching the Docker Hub auth token
# (seen 2026-09-14 on the first e2e.yml run). A pull is idempotent and
# resumable, so retrying with backoff turns that into a non-event.

# spio_retry <attempts> <initial-delay-seconds> <command> [args...]
#
# Runs the command until it succeeds or <attempts> is exhausted, sleeping
# <delay> seconds between tries and doubling the delay each time.
# Returns the command's last exit status.
