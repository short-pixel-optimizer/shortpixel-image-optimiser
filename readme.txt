== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does ShortPixel compare to other image optimisation plugins (e.g Smush, Imagify, TinyPNG, Kraken, EWWW, Optimole)?  =
	ShortPixel consistently has better compression rates along with more features, backup support and has very affordable one-time or monthly plans.
	Here are a couple of independent reviews:
	AuthorityHacker - "ShortPixel is our tool of choice, simply because it’s pretty much automated – we just let it do its thing." (<a href="https://www.authorityhacker.com/best-wordpress-image-optimizer/" target="_blank">read full review</a>)
	WP Modula - "One of the reasons I’m personally a huge fan of ShortPixel is the built-in support for next-gen image formats like WebP." (<a href="https://wp-modula.com/the-best-wordpress-image-optimization-plugins/" target="_blank">read full review</a>)

= Can I use the same API Key on multiple web sites? =
    Yes, you can.
    As long as you have available credits, you can use a single API Key on as many websites as you wish!

= What plan is better for me? What do you recommend? =
	Everyone has different needs, but generally, we recommend getting a One-Time plan to optimize your whole Media Library and then get a Monthly plan to optimize your future uploads. To learn more, have a look at <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/30-monthly-plans-vs-one-time-plans" target="_blank">this comparison</a>

= I don't know how many thumbnails do I have, what plan should I take?
	To know how many thumbnails you have, just install the plugin and go to Media > Bulk ShortPixel. The plugin will tell you how many thumbnails you've got. Based on this, have a look at <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing" target="_blank">our plans</a>

= Can I upgrade/downgrade easily my plan? =
	Of course. You can upgrade or downgrade your plans in a couple of clicks from your account on shortpixel.com.

= Can I test/use the plugin for free? =
    Yes, you can.
    We offer 100 free image optimization credits each month. Exceeding the monthly free quota will pause the optimization process till the quota is reset or extended by buying one of our plans.

= Can I optimize images that aren't in Media Library? =
    Absolutely.
    You can actually optimize any image you have on your site regardless of its place. You just need to add - in the Advanced section of the ShortPixel Settings - the folders where the images you want to optimize are located and ShortPixel will work its magic and do the rest.

= Can I optimize images that are both past and new? =
    Sure!
    You can optimize all your past/current images and photos using our "Bulk ShortPixel" page in your Media with a single click.

= A credit = an optimized image? =
    Yes, that is correct.
    But please note that usually, an image in Media Library has 5 or more associated thumbs. Each optimized thumbnail requires a credit. In the rare cases when ShortPixel does not optimise the image (lossy) with at least 5%, the credit will not be consumed, though.

= Can I restore my images? What happens with the originals? =
    If you choose the "Image backup" option in Settings/ShortPixel then the original version of any optimized image or PDF will be saved in the backup folder.
    The original image is needed if you want to restore an image or if you want to convert an image from lossy/glossy to lossless or vice-versa.

= What types of formats can be optimized? =
    ShortPixel optimises JPEG (JPG, JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR), PNG, GIF (animated and still), and PDF type of files.

= Do you have one-time plans? =
    Yes we do.
    The credits that come with our <a href="https://shortpixel.com/plans" >one-time plans</a> never expire. Yummy! :-)

= What happens to my existing images? =
    Your existing images are replaced with the optimized ones.
    If you choose the backup option then the originals will be saved in a separate folder so you can restore them should you ever need/want to do that.

= How does the plugin work? =
    Our lightweight plugin sends the original images to our Image Optimization Cloud where they are compressed. ShortPixel then downloads the optimized images and the unoptimized originals are replaced with the optimised versions.

= Do you optimize images in the cloud? =
    Yes, all the images processed by ShortPixel are optimized in the Cloud. This takes the load off of your server and allows us to produce the best results.

= What payment methods are accepted? =
    We accept payments via card (Mastercard, Visa, Maestro, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, UnionPay), PayPal, and Apple Pay.

= How do I activate the API key on a multisite? =
    You have to activate the plugin in the network admin and then activate it manually on each individual site in the multisite. Once you have done that, the Settings menu appears and you can add the API key for each individual site.
    As an alternative, you can edit wp-config.php and add this line:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_API_KEY', 'APIKEY');`
where `APIKEY` is the API Key received upon sign up.
    If configured that way, the API key will be used for all the sites of the multisite but will only be visible on the main site’s Settings page, being hidden for the rest of the sites.

= I am not the only one working on the WordPress Dashboard. How can I hide my API key? =
    There is a simple way to hide the API key, all you need to do is to add these two lines in your wp-config.php:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_API_KEY', '<<your api key here>>');`
`define('SHORTPIXEL_HIDE_API_KEY', true);`

= How much is a credit? =
    A credit is used each time ShortPixel optimizes an image or thumbnail by at least 5%. If we're not able to optimize an image or thumbnail by at least 5% then no credit will be used :-)
    Please also note that usually images in your Media Library have 3-5 thumbs associated and a credit will be used for each featured image or associated thumbnail that is optimized.

= Why shall I use a WordPress plugin and not an offline tool? =
    Because ShortPixel algorithms were perfected while optimizing over 3.5 billion real-life images.
    ShortPixel not only offers the best compression for JPEG, PNG, GIF, and PDF files but it also saves you a lot of time. You just install it on your site and then ShortPixel will take care that all the images on your site are immediately optimized after upload.

= Does optimizing images affect my ALT tags? =
    No, ShortPixel only optimizes images, it won't touch anything else like your HTML/CSS.

= If I stop using ShortPixel will my images remain optimized? =
    Absolutely!
    Once optimized, the images will remain optimized unless you explicitly choose to restore them. But why would you do that? :-)

= Do I have to pay monthly or one time? =
    We have both options available.
    One-time credits never expire and are a bit more expensive. Check out our prices <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing" >here</a>

= When can I cancel a monthly plan? =
    Whenever you want.
    The credits you still have available for the current billing period will still be available until the end of the billing period. At the end of it, you won't be billed again and the plan will be reset to the free plan.

= When do credits expire? =
    Monthly credits expire after 30 days while one-time credits never expire.

= Do you have an API? =
    Yes, we have several APIs and tools.
    You can learn more about it here:
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/api-tools">https://shortpixel.com/api-tools</a>

= Can I use the ShortPixel WP plugin on a localhost installation? =
    Unfortunately not :-(
    But you can use either our command line tool or our web tool
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/web-tool-docs">https://shortpixel.com/web-tool-docs</a>
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/cli-docs">https://shortpixel.com/cli-docs</a>

= How does resizing work? =
    If you choose the option to resize images on your site, then the featured image can be resized to a predefined size while keeping its aspect and proportions intact. The associated thumbs won't be resized.
    Using this option you can safely upload original images safely without needing to apply any pre-processing to make them smaller.

= Will ShortPixel work if my website is using CloudFare? =
    Absolutely! Sometimes you'll need to make sure you whitelist some IPs, just <a href="https://shortpixel.com/contact">contact us</a> and we'll assist you with that.

= Where do I report security bugs found in this plugin? =
Please report security bugs found in the source code of the ShortPixel Image Optimizer plugin through the [Patchstack Vulnerability Disclosure Program](https://patchstack.com/database/vdp/shortpixel-image-optimiser). The Patchstack team will assist you with verification, CVE assignment, and notify the developers of this plugin.

== Actions and Filters for Developers ==

The ShortPixel Image Optimiser plugin calls the following actions and filters:

`do_action( 'shortpixel_image_optimised', $post_id );`
upon successful optimization;

`do_action("shortpixel_before_restore_image", $post_id);`
before restoring an image from backup;

`do_action("shortpixel_after_restore_image", $post_id);`
after succesful restore;

For version 4.22.10 and earlier:

`apply_filters("shortpixel_backup_folder", $backup_folder, $main_file_path, $sizes);`
just before returning the ShortPixel backup folder, usually /wp-content/uploads/ShortpixelBackups. The `$sizes` are the sizes array from metadata;

For version 5.0.0 and later:

`$directory = apply_filters("shortpixel/file/backup_folder", $directory, $file);`
just before returning the ShortPixel backup folder, usually /wp-content/uploads/ShortpixelBackups).

`apply_filters('shortpixel_image_exists', file_exists($path), $path, $post_id);`
post ID is not always set, only if it's an image from Media Library;

`apply_filters('shortpixel_image_urls', $URLs, $post_id);`
filters the URLs that will be sent to optimisation, `$URLs` is a plain array;

<strong>The filter below is deprecated starting with version 5.0.0!</strong>

`apply_filters('shortpixel/db/chunk_size', $chunk);`
the `$chunk` is the value ShortPixel chooses to use as the number of selected records in one query (based on total table size), some hosts work better with a different value;

For version 4.22.10 and earlier:

`apply_filters('shortpixel/backup/paths', $PATHs, $mainPath);`
filters the array of paths of the images sent for backup and can be used to exclude certain paths/images/thumbs from being backed up, based on the image path. `$mainPath` is the path of the main image, while `$PATHs` is an array with all files to be backed up (including thumbnails);

For version 5.0.0 and later:

`apply_filters('shortpixel/image/skip_backup', false, $this->getFullPath(), $this->is_main_file)`
filters the images that are skipped or not from the backup. Return true for the type of images to be skipped in the backup. If you check if `is_main_file` is true and return false (do not skip backup), while while otherwise returning true, the backup will be kept only for the main image. We suggest using it in conjuction with this action that fires right after the restore from backup is done:

`do_action('shortpixel/image/after_restore', $this, $this->id, $cleanRestore);`
This action can be used to cleanup the meta data from the database, regenerate thumbnails after restoring the main file, writing the updated meta data, etc.

`apply_filters('shortpixel/settings/image_sizes', $sizes);`
filters the array (`$sizes`) of image sizes that can be excluded from processing (displayed in the plugin Advanced settings);

`apply_filters('shortpixel/image/imageparamlist', $result, $this->id, $this);`
filters the list of parameters sent to the API so that resizing can be performed more granularly;

`apply_filters('shortpixel/api/request', $requestParameters, $item_id);`
filters the parameters sent to the optimization API (through `$requestParameters`), described in detail here: <a href="https://shortpixel.com/api-docs" target="_blank">ShortPixel Reducer API</a>; `$item_id` contains the ID of the Media Library item, or the ID of the Custom Media item (when used). In short, this filter can be used to alter any parameters sent to the API, depending on the needs. For example, you can set different resize parameters for different post types, different compression levels, remove EXIF or not, covert WebP/AVIF, and basically any other parameter that is sent to the API for a specific image (together with all its thumbnails).

This filter enables the background ShortPixel processing in additional pages (see <a href="https://shortpixel.com/knowledge-base/article/334-on-what-pages-does-spio-optimize-images" target="_blank">here</a> the original list). Here's an example of this filter that enables the processing on the Comments screen (to be placed in your functions.php file):

`
add_filter('shortpixel/init/optimize_on_screens', function ($screens) {
	$screens[] = 'edit-comments';
	return $screens;
});
`
The `edit-comments` is the ID of the screen where you want to enable the processing.

If you want to add multiple pages, here's what the snippet looks like:

`
add_filter('shortpixel/init/optimize_on_screens', function ($screens) {
	$screens = array('edit-comments', 'plugins', 'another-custom-post-type-page');
	return $screens;
	});
`

`add_filter('shortpixel/image/filecheck', function () { return true; });`
This filter forces a file check for WebP/AVIF in case they were manually removed from disk.

If you want to disable the automatic cache flush that is triggered after image optimization, you can use this filter:

`add_filter( 'shortpixel/external/flush_cache', function() { return false; } );`

In order to define custom thumbnails to be picked up by the optimization you have two options, both comma separated defines:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_CUSTOM_THUMB_SUFFIXES', '_tl,_tr');`
will handle custom thumbnails like image-100x100_tl.jpg;

`define('SHORTPIXEL_CUSTOM_THUMB_INFIXES', '-uae');`
 will handle custom thumbnails like image-uae-100x100.jpg;

`define('SHORTPIXEL_USE_DOUBLE_WEBP_EXTENSION', true);`
`define('SHORTPIXEL_USE_DOUBLE_AVIF_EXTENSION', true);`
will tell the plugin to create double extensions for the WebP/AVIF image counterparts, for example, image.jpg.webp/image.jpg.avif for image.jpg;

Enable the "Trusted mode" in case the file system has limitations and is very slow in responding to direct file operations by adding this constant:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_TRUSTED_MODE', true);`

This will simply skip file check operations and if the Media Library loads very slowly or freezes, you might want to try adding the constant above to your wp-config.php file.

Disable the feedback survey when the plugin is deactivated:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_SKIP_FEEDBACK', true);`

Hide the Cloudflare settings by defining these constants in wp-config.php:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_CFTOKEN', 'the Cloudflare API token that has Purge Cache right');`
`define('SHORTPIXEL_CFZONE', 'The Zone ID from the domain settings in Cloudflare');`

Add HTTP basic authentication credentials by defining these constants in wp-config.php

`define('SHORTPIXEL_HTTP_AUTH_USER', 'user');`
`define('SHORTPIXEL_HTTP_AUTH_PASSWORD', 'pass');`
