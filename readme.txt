== Description ==

**A freemium, easy to use, comprehensive, stable and frequently updated image compression plugin supported by the friendly team that created it.  :)**

Increase your website's SEO ranking, number of visitors and ultimately your sales by optimising any image or PDF document on your website.
ShortPixel is an easy to use, lightweight, install-and-forget-about-it <a href="https://shortpixel.com" target="_blank">image optimization</a> plugin that can compress all your past images and PDF documents with a single click. New images are automatically resized/rescaled and optimized on the fly, in the background. It's also compatible with any gallery, slider or ecommerce plugin.

**Ready for a quick DEMO? Test our plugin <a href="https://wpsandbox.net/" target="_blank">here</a>.**
Or you can create a staging copy of your site using <a href="https://wp-staging.com/" target="_blank">WP Staging</a> and test it there.

Short Pixel uses minimal resources and works well with any shared, cloud, VPS or dedicated web hosting. It can optimize any image you have on your website even the images that aren't listed in Media Library like those in galleries like <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/nextgen-gallery/" target="_blank">NextGEN</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/modula-best-grid-gallery/" target="_blank">Modula</a> or added directly via FTP!

Both lossy and lossless image compression are available for the most common image types (JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP and AVIF) plus PDF files.
We also offer **glossy** JPEG compression which is a very high quality lossy optimization algorithm. Specially designed for photographers!
Optimized images mean better user experience, better PageSpeed Insights or GTmetrix results, better Google PageRank and more visitors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does ShortPixel compare to other image optimisation plugins (e.g Smush, Imagify, TinyPNG, Kraken, EWWW, Optimole)?  =
	ShortPixel consistently has better compression rates along with more features, backup support and has very affordable one-time or monthly plans.
	Here are a couple of independent reviews:
	AuthorityHacker - "ShortPixel is our tool of choice, simply because it’s pretty much automated – we just let it do its thing." (<a href="https://www.authorityhacker.com/best-wordpress-image-optimizer/" target="_blank">read full review</a>)
	WP Modula - "One of the reasons I’m personally a huge fan of ShortPixel is the built-in support for next-gen image formats like WebP." (<a href="https://wp-modula.com/the-best-wordpress-image-optimization-plugins/" target="_blank">read full review</a>)

= Can I use the same API Key on multiple web sites? =
    Yes, you can.
    As long as you have available credits, you can use a single API Key on as many websites as you wish!

= What plan is better for me? What do you recommend? =
	Everyone has different needs, but generally, we recommend getting a One-Time plan to optimize your whole Media Library and then get a Monthly plan to optimize your future uploads. To learn more, have a look at <a href="https://help.shortpixel.com/article/30-monthly-plans-vs-one-time-plans" target="_blank">this comparison</a>

= I don't know how many thumbnails do I have, what plan should I take?
	To know how many thumbnails you have, just install the plugin and go to Media > Bulk ShortPixel. The plugin will tell you how many thumbnails you've got. Based on this, have a look at <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing" target="_blank">our plans</a>

= Can I upgrade/downgrade easily my plan? =
	Of course. You can upgrade or downgrade your plans in a couple of clicks from your account on shortpixel.com.

= Can I test/use the plugin for free? =
    Yes, you can.
    We offer 100 free image optimization credits each month. Exceeding the monthly free quota will pause the optimization process till the quota is reset or extended by buying one of our plans.

= Can I optimize images that aren't in Media Library? =
    Absolutely.
    You can actually optimize any image you have on your site regardless of its place. You just need to add - in the Advanced section of the ShortPixel Settings - the folders where the images you want to optimize are located and ShortPixel will work its magic and do the rest.

= Can I optimize images that are both past and new? =
    Sure!
    You can optimize all your past/current images and photos using our "Bulk ShortPixel" page in your Media with a single click.

= A credit = an optimized image? =
    Yes, that is correct.
    But please note that usually an image in Media Library has 3, 5 or more associated thumbs. Each optimized thumb requires a credit. In the rare cases when ShortPixel does not optimise the image (lossy) with at least 5%, the credit will not be consumed, though.

= Can I restore my images? What happens with the originals? =
    If you choose the "Image backup" option in Settings/ShortPixel then the original version of any optimized image or PDF will be saved in the backup folder.
    The original image is needed if you want to restore an image or if you want to convert an image from lossy/glossy to lossless or viceversa.

= What types of formats can be optimized? =
    ShortPixel optimises JPEG (JPG, JPEG, JPEG 2000, JPEG XR), PNG, GIF (animated and still) and PDF type of files.

= Do you have one-time plans? =
    Yes we do.
    The credits that come with our <a href="https://shortpixel.com/plans" >one-time plans</a> never expire. Yummy! :-)

= What happens to my existing images? =
    Your existing images are replaced with the optimized ones.
    If you choose the backup option then the originals will be saved in a separate folder so you can restore them should you ever need/want to do that.

= How does the plugin work? =
    Our light-weight plugin sends the original images to our Image Optimization Cloud where they are compressed. ShortPixel then downloads the optimized images and the unoptimized originals are replaced with the optimised versions.

= Do you optimize images in the cloud? =
    Yes, all the images processsed by ShortPixel are optimized in the Cloud. This takes the load off of your server and allows us to produce the best results.

= What payment methods are accepted? =
    We accept payments via card (Mastercard, Visa, Maestro, American Express, Discover, Diners Club, JCB, UnionPay), PayPal and Apple Pay.

= How do I activate the API key on a multisite? =
    You have to activate the plugin in the network admin and then activate it manually on each individual site in the multisite. Once you have done that, the Settings menu appears and you can add the API key for each individual site.
    As an alternative, you can edit wp-config.php and add this line:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_API_KEY', 'APIKEY');`
where `APIKEY` is the API Key received upon sign up.
    If configured that way, the API key will be used for all the sites of the multisite but will only be visible on the main site’s Settings page, being hidden for the rest of the sites.

= I am not the only one working in the WordPress Dashboard. How can I hide my API key? =
    There is a simple way to hide the API key, all you need to do is to add these two lines in your wp-config.php:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_API_KEY', '<<your api key here>>');`
`define('SHORTPIXEL_HIDE_API_KEY', true);`

= How much is a credit? =
    A credit is used each time ShortPixel optimizes an image or thumbnail by at least 5%. If we're not able to optimize an image or thumbnail by at least 5% then no credit will be used :-)
    Please also note that usually images in your Media Library have 3-5 thumbs associated and a credit will be used for each featured image or associated thumbnail that is optimized.

= Why shall I use a wordpress plugin and not an offline tool? =
    Because ShortPixel algorithms were perfected while optimizing over 3.5 billion real-life images.
    ShortPixel not only offers the best compression for JPEG, PNG, GIF and PDF files but it also saves you a lot of time. You just install it on your site and then ShortPixel will take care that all the images on your site are immediately optimized after upload.

= Does optimizing images affect my ALT tags? =
    No, ShortPixel only optimizes images, it won't touch anything else like your HTML/CSS.

= If I stop using ShortPixel will my images remain optimized? =
    Absolutely!
    Once optimized, the images will remain optimized unless you explicitly choose to restore them. But why would you do that? :-)

= Do I have to pay monthly or one time? =
    We have both options available.
    One-time credits never expire are a bit more expensive. Check out our prices <a href="https://shortpixel.com/pricing" >here</a>

= When can I cancel a monthly plan? =
    Whenever you want.
    The credits you still have available for the current billing period will still be available until the end of the billing period. At the end of it, you won't be billed again and the plan will be reset to the free plan.

= When credits expire? =
    Monthly credits expire after 30 days while one-time credits never expire.

= Do you have an API? =
    Yes, we have several APIs and tools.
    You can learn more about it here:
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/api-tools">https://shortpixel.com/api-tools</a>

= Can I use ShortPixel WP plugin on a localhost installation? =
    Unfortunately not :-(
    But you can use either our command line tool or our web tool
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/web-tool-docs">https://shortpixel.com/web-tool-docs</a>
    <a href="https://shortpixel.com/cli-docs">https://shortpixel.com/cli-docs</a>

= How does resizing work? =
    If you choose the option to resize images on your site, then the featured image can be resized to a predefined size while keeping its aspect and proportions intact. The associated thumbs won't be resized.
    Using this option you can safely upload original images safely without needing to apply any pre-processing to make them smaller.

= Will ShortPixel work if my website is using CloudFare? =
    Absolutely! Sometimes you'll need to make sure you whitelist some IPs, just <a href="https://shortpixel.com/contact">contact us</a> and we'll assist you with that.

= I’m stuck. What do I do? =

== Actions and Filters for Developers ==

The ShortPixel Image Optimiser plugin calls the following actions and filters:

`do_action( 'shortpixel_image_optimised', $post_id );`
upon successful optimization;

`do_action("shortpixel_before_restore_image", $post_id);`
before restoring an image from backup;

`do_action("shortpixel_after_restore_image", $post_id);`
after succesful restore;

`apply_filters("shortpixel_backup_folder", $backup_folder, $main_file_path, $sizes);`
just before returning the ShortPixel backup folder, usually /wp-content/uploads/ShortpixelBackups. The `$sizes` are the sizes array from metadata;

`apply_filters('shortpixel_image_exists', file_exists($path), $path, $post_id);`
post ID is not always set, only if it's an image from Media Library;

`apply_filters('shortpixel_image_urls', $URLs, $post_id);`
filters the URLs that will be sent to optimisation, `$URLs` is a plain array;

`apply_filters('shortpixel/db/chunk_size', $chunk);`
the `$chunk` is the value ShortPixel chooses to use as number of selected records in one query (based on total table size), some hosts work better with a different value;

`apply_filters('shortpixel/backup/paths', $PATHs, $mainPath);`
filters the array of paths of the images sent for backup and can be used to exclude certain paths/images/thumbs from being backed up, based on the image path. `$mainPath` is the path of the main image, while `$PATHs` is an array with all files to be backed up (including thumbnails);

`apply_filters('shortpixel/settings/image_sizes', $sizes);`
filters the array (`$sizes`) of image sizes which can be excluded from processing (displayed in the plugin Advanced settings).

In order to define custom thumbnails to be picked up by the optimization you have two options, both comma separated defines:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_CUSTOM_THUMB_SUFFIXES', '_tl,_tr');`
will handle custom thumbnails like image-100x100_tl.jpg;

`define('SHORTPIXEL_CUSTOM_THUMB_INFIXES', '-uae');`
 will handle custom thumbnails like image-uae-100x100.jpg;

`define('SHORTPIXEL_USE_DOUBLE_WEBP_EXTENSION', true);`
will tell the plugin to create double extensions for the WebP image counterparts, for example image.jpg.webp for image.jpg;

`define("SHORTPIXEL_NOFLOCK", true);`
don't use flock queue, only activate this when you have `flock()` denied errors on your installation;

`define("SHORTPIXEL_EXPERIMENTAL_SECURICACHE", true);`
adds timestamps to URLS, to prevent hitting the cache. Useful for persistent caches.

Hide the Cloudflare settings by defining these constants in wp-config.php:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_CFTOKEN', 'the Cloudflare API token that has Purge Cache right');`
`define('SHORTPIXEL_CFZONE', 'The Zone ID from the domain settings in Cloudflare');`

Hide the WSO banner in the settings by defining this constant in wp-config.php:

`define('SHORTPIXEL_NO_BANNER', true);`

Alternatively, you can use this filter in your theme's functions.php file:

`add_filter('shortpixel/settings/no_banner', true);`
